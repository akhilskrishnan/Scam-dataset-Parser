# An early stage sample Dataset Builder for Scam call detection system research project

This is a sample of one of the non-call (without the voice call) data obtaining tools for the scam call detection system. Uses the Word2Vec and other NLP techniques like lemmatization, stop word removal etc, primarily using the youtube transcript API to get closed caption outputs. Used very early in the research project for sample testing.
