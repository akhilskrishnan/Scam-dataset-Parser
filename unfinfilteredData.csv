very very supportive of us and they're
the whole reason that we can even do
this help you help make videos do live

everything to be able to function
there's a lot of people that are gonna
want to know why you deserve this
you understand what I'm saying you've
worked in scamming for a while
I believe you when you say you don't
like it and you want to leave but you
know what there's a lot of people also
too that would prefer to spend their
money to help people that have been
stolen
you know there are there is arguably
other ways we don't ask our squad for
help that much we've asked a couple of
times for one other X scammer and when
we wanted to raise money for a TV show
that we're working on we don't do this
often it wouldn't be it wouldn't be
right
we do it when we feel passionate and and
when we feel like it's really something
that we're going to turn into something
better something that we believe so if
we're gonna take a risk on you by
putting our word on the line people are
gonna want to know they want to hear
from you they want to hear your story

welcome to
right from when i started creating
youtube videos i've always wondered what
scam call centers looked like
but because it's difficult for me to get
to delhi i've done the next best thing
i've got someone in delhi to help me out
and that someone
is karl rock he's another youtuber and
there'll be a good bit more about his
channel
later in this video so between us we've
managed to expose yet another call
center
this one is called renewed technology of
the rohini district of new delhi
and this video is going to describe how
we managed to take this call center
completely out of action critical alert
like a lot of other scam call centers
renewed technology
pays a third party to divert a phone
number to their call center
at certain times of the day whenever
they have people ready to man the phones
these are two examples of the pop-ups
which were used by this call center
there's a uk and the us version of it
and of course this sort of pop-up
deliberately freezes your pc and is an
audible warning
to try and attract phone calls and it
doesn't matter who phones the number
they will get young or old in any
profession including nurses
thank you for calling support decide mac
how may i help you
yes my computer's beeping it says
someone
signed on to my computer and it's
it's a suspicious activity and i could
get an infection promise
i'm really sorry to hear that ma'am can
i ask you what exactly you was doing
when you got that kind of a message or
an alert ma'am
all i did was put in the american heart
association
all i did was put in top 10 american
heart association.org
to print my i'm a nurse and i took a cpr
class
these fake virus adverts typically
reside on websites which are quite close
to the real thing
but maybe misspelled by a couple of
letters and now that he has the call
this scammer will attempt to get money
out of his victim
when i phone with new technology just
like the nurse before me they tried to
convince me that it was a real virus
and that i needed to pay something for
new security
so most people who do fall for this sort
of scam aren't even aware that they're a
victim
i've fast-forwarded through the scam to
the point where steve smith whose real
name is muhammad aftab
is trying to get me to pay for this
software our services
and feel comfortable about it so you can
upgrade it at any point of time so
he's typed in renown computer.com
there's a link in the description but i
suspect this site won't be around for
very much longer
always upgrade the security anytime and
we will be purchasing the security
in front of you whatever we will be
going to do sir will be done
in front of you only sir my keylogger
shows clearly that his password
is anshu at00 this is not an
insignificant password
and i need to tell you sir like i just
need to let you know about it in today's
time
never use your any device without a
security sir you can see we are what we
are putting
is an advanced identity protector sir
let's ignore his waffle here for a
second and look carefully at the
delivery address the name is clearly
hemanshu naigam it will again come back
without putting the security so
as it turns out himanshu naigam is the
managing director of this company
the real name is renewed technologies
not renowned computer write it down my
details on a piece it's a visa card or a
mastercard which you use for the payment
sir
whilst i'm keeping him busy pretending
to pay him i'm actually making a reverse
connection to his pc
and downloading some of his files some
of the documents reveal that they have
several different aliases renowned
computers as one
web infotech llc is another and some of
their older checks
showed that they used the name tech
philosophers llc
but most revealing of all was a
password-protected spreadsheet
in this spreadsheet i had the full
details of all of their victims
and just how much money renewed
technology had made in the last three
months
nearly ninety thousand dollars there
were other tabs in this spreadsheet
which clearly showed that they pretended
to be quickbook
tech support and also aimed their
pop-ups at uk
people but i still wanted to find out
more about who these scammers were
i had the names of the managing
directors but who were the people
manning the phones
this is why it's always useful whenever
a scammer
logs onto their personal facebook page
here we have muhammad aftab
looking at a facebook page called call
centers forum
these forum pages advertise legitimate
business
but also scams when aftab goes back to
his personal page
i can see exactly who it is that's
logged in and from that facebook page
it's possible to get a better look at
the person who tried to scam me
this is what he looks like and i was
also able to find out the names of all
of the other scammers
praveen chandra sonny manish shivan
peter
and sahil this spreadsheet shows that
they're taking gift cards as payments as
well
ebay gamestop gateway xbox
target amongst others but i wanted to
find out exactly where this call center
was
when i looked at zubacorp for renewed
technology private
it gave one address but yet when i
looked at google maps for re-owned
computer
it gave a completely different address
close by
but still i didn't know exactly where
this was
so this is where i needed a bit of help
from my friend carl rock
carl is originally from new zealand but
he now lives in delhi
and he produces lots of videos on what
it's like to live
in india some of those videos include
all about
scammers and travel safety but he also
has a much more realistic view
of the rest of india i would really
encourage you
to have a look and subscribe to carl's
channel
carl's channel will tell you about the
real india and how much indians actually
hate
the people who are running scams please
take a look
so thanks to carl and another one of my
subscribers i managed to get a number of
pictures of this call center
it sat above a solicitor's office in
rohini in delhi
the agents only operated at night time
because that was the us
daytime there was no obvious signage
that this was indeed renewed
technologies private limited
so carl's wife asked the solicitors
downstairs
whether there was a call center above
them she confirmed this
and i've linked to carl's version of the
video down below
he wasn't able to see into the offices
because as you can see there's some
blackout curtains
there is usually a window open and they
seem to be using it as an ash tray
the agents would use a door at the side
of the premises whenever the us
shift started so i spent the next few
days and weeks
working out exactly how the scam center
operated
i observed how they bought pop-ups from
various vendors
i saw them make outbound calls
pretending to be yahoo and apple
i even watched them create one of their
outbound robocalls
and if you're a patron of mine you can
see a much more detailed version of this
video
in your feed so over those days i
created a one-page version
of how that organization fitted together
and this is what it looks like
we have a company called renewed
technology in delhi which is owned by
himanshu nagam
who's also the director of dexter's
communication
both of these companies buy voip
services
and pop-up services from various people
around them
in india they make use of these services
in order to scam people mostly in the
usa
when they do get victims in the usa they
will process the check
payments through webinfotec llc.com
this is a company which is owned by
mahir shah
in the usa the various call center
agents
will use a number of company aliases to
collect these payments
either web infotech webmasters or tech
philosophers
having multiple sites allows them to
continue their business
even if one gets shut down all very
clever
so now that i knew how the whole
organization worked it was time to
dismantle them
and i started with their phone numbers
what you're looking at here is the
scammer managing their phone service
it's provided by a legitimate company
called therealpbx.com
and they supply the us phone numbers
which these scammers in india use
however what i'm just about to do is
flood
those phone numbers the call blasting
software
is supplied by scammerblaster.com
and as the name suggests it's a very
effective way
of taking a phone number out of service
i've left a link to this in the
description below
so i picked all of the numbers and over
the next few days
i consistently blasted these numbers
with various floods
and you're probably wondering what it's
like to be at the receiving end of one
of these call floods
we'll have a look at this
thank you very much
foreign
foreign
and don't forget that every one of these
calls is not only costing these scammers
some money
but it's tying up the phone lines so
that real victims can't even get through
win win
i also did the right thing and reported
these numbers to the realpbx.com
where they had most of their us phone
numbers and ringcentral.com
where they had some uk versions when the
call flooding started renewed
technologies didn't know exactly what to
do
so they got in touch with their voip
provider and i could see them having an
online conversation
with one of the agents for some reason
our scammer just doesn't know how to
explain that he's getting bombarded by
these calls
our scammer tries to explain that
there's lots of these prank calls
and the helpful agent suggests that
perhaps the phone number
was submitted to the wrong campaign the
scammer explains that they're not
customers or even
people but they're actually songs
playing and the big advantage with scam
blasting
is that they're random numbers every
single phone call
so there's no way that they can just ban
a single number that won't stop it
the other helpful agent suggests that a
way around this is to get the customer
to press a button
so this will reduce the number of calls
reaching agents but they will still be
charged for every single call
but they still can't quite work out why
they're getting all these calls
everything was okay until that day
and the agent again suggests that
someone is trying to hamper their
business
they say they haven't shared these
numbers with anyone so they're still
confused as to why they're getting the
calls
finally they suggest that they need to
replace the two numbers that they've
been given
so to my absolute delight they ordered
two new phone numbers
and guess what my next move was
yes
but call flooding was only part of the
way to bring down this call center i
noticed that they also used
authorized.net
for their payments and the payments were
substantial
over five hundred thousand dollars in
the space of nearly three years
so i wrote to authorize.net and provided
them some audio and video of the scams
in action
but i couldn't rely on this alone most
victims of this scam
won't even know that they're a victim so
i decided to write to every one of the
people that i'd found on their customer
list
in the email i pointed out to each
victim that it was a scam
on how they should go about getting
their money back they should approach
their bank or credit card company
and ask for a refund i also confronted
the owners of renewed technology
and web infotech llc can you refund them
okay and have you started doing that
we started making it like i said we
started making the calls
if they ask for a refund we will no no
no no no no
not if they ask for it so you've taken
money off them
under fraudulent circumstances you don't
need to
have the excuse that they didn't ask for
their money back you should be just
giving it no no no we
we are not giving it back because if
they want the support to continue we are
supporting them
ridiculous they were scammed into
getting services from your company
you should return this
i told you my side of the story you are
free to do whatever right so you
actually want to keep their money yeah
if they will ask us for the refund we
will defend them okay
that's yours that's fine you stick with
that then and we'll see what happens
thank you thank you bye
and next i go after himanchu i confront
him with all of the evidence before he
finally admits what he's going to do
next
okay okay so ronnie would like to tell
you
i've already shut it down everything is
shuttered down and
and what else you want to know
well um i would like to know are you
really going to shut down
or do we have to keep flooding those
numbers
the blaster does it need to keep going
no no no i only do this
so you're gonna stop scamming are you
you're not doing anything wrong okay so
all of the people
that you've taken money from via
your various company names renowned
computers
and web info
you're going to shut all that operation
down yeah
yes you're going to okay are you
are you really going to shut them down
yes yes
well okay so when does that happen
we already wrapped up everything if you
got this much information then you must
have aware about that we started calling
to our customers who are not happy and
you've already told the customers that
we are going to refund the money and
everything and of course i didn't
believe one word he said to me
but what was clear was that he was
really going to shut down the operation
i observed as i started to delete all of
the files
not only in the local pcs but on the
servers that they used to store
important information so with a bit of
perseverance
we've finally managed to get one call
center shut down
if only temporarily lastly if you enjoy
watching videos about getting one over
on scammers
please consider becoming a patron of
mine you'll get early access to videos
or like in this case access to a more
detailed video which gives more
information on this call center

i'm working in scam call center it's the
social security

willing to do it
please just tell me what i need to do
i'm confused and i don't know what to do
anymore
i never actually thought of working in a
scam like this but you see every time i
was searching for a job
it's always a call center that you know
has some vacancies and you see
when i applied there they won't tell you
right away that you know it's just scam
anything but after you
work there after you start like half a
month then you'll start to realize that
that it's not like some kind of a
regular job
i know i'm a scammer and you guys will
probably have a hard time to believe me
but
please i don't have any other choice i
don't have anyone who i can
you know turn to just right now

i'm the second oldest in my family after
my sister and i have two younger
siblings
my dad passed away when i when i was
just a teenager and
you see after a few years of his passing
i
had to drop out of school because of
financial issues and
i had to do labor in order to help
support my family
you see a few years later i got my
girlfriend pregnant and so i
had to take responsibility but
it became very difficult to provide for
my family with labor so
i had to look for another job and
at the time it was really hard i was
really having a hard time finding a
decent
you know a job with a decent pay
so this is the quarantine center that
i'm staying at
i've been here for the past eight days
and
i got two more days left and after that
i'll be home
with my family
[Music]
i kept searching for jobs until one day
i found an
ad on the internet i called the number
and went in for an interview and
later i got the job but at that time
i didn't really know what a scam cost in
the west and i didn't even know exactly
what they do in the call center or other
than just
talking to people on the phone
[Music]
after a few weeks of being yelled at by
people on the phone so they realized it
was a fake call center and
all we're doing was this was a scam
a few months later the office got waited
and we were arrested and
we got locked up for a month but the bus
took care of it and we got out and
i was scared the next time i will be
arrested i might not be able to see my
family
again
[Music]
but the case was still open and the boss
said that if we don't work with him he
will never
help close the case and so
i don't want any problems in the future
i didn't really have a choice so i
agreed
[Music]
you know i still stayed in the call
center but i stopped scamming people and
all i did was just take my salary and no
incentive
[Music]
[Music]
i wouldn't have the courage to do this
if it wasn't trilogy media
[Music]
they gave me hope and they listened to
me and helped me when no one else
could and they were there for me and
because of that i am forever
in their depth
[Music]
and i'm able to quit the job because of
them and i have no intentions of ever
working again as a scammer in the future
and you see i have other dreams and
goals too and i want to pursue them now
and right now i have a dream to start a
fish farm

"Greetings Friends, how's it?"
You are not gonna believe this!
My Cyber Cop friend found the same scammer from one of my videos last year!
"And you're going to hear him realise this, and then give him a taste of his own medicine."
"But before we listen to the call, here's how the scam works."
This fraudster is running a scam where he calls people who are renting apartments on eBay.
He pretends to be an Army Officer posted in Mumbai.
"And without bargaining or even seeing your property,"
he tells you he'll send you a QR code so he can pay you an advance on the property.
"Except if you scan this QR code, it withdrawls money from your account and sends it to the scammer!"
"Apartment Owner: Yes, Sir?"
"Scammer: Sir, my boss will pay you..."
"You're the one who wants to rent the flat, why will your boss pay?"
"No, my boss will pay. I don't have any money because digital payment apps aren't allowed in the Army cantonment."
 So that's why I've given my debit card to my boss and he'll pay you.
You shouldn't give your debit card like that to someone! There are a lot of scams going on and people are greedy!
"He's my boss, not a stranger."
"But still, there's a lot of scams going on. You know, someone scammed my Wife and then she divorced me!"
"I know him well, he's not a stranger.
- Yeah, I know you're an Army Officer. But these scams led to divorce for me."
What can I do about your divorce???
"I know, but I'm just giving you advice as a brother."
"Once you lose the money, then your Wife leaves you! You know how it is, people are mean these days."
"""Not all fingers are the same length."" Not all wives are like that.
- You mean your Wife is good?"
"Yeah, not everyone is like that.
- Yeah, ok, I agree."
"The whole world...
- I've watched a YouTube video and your voice sounds familiar!"
What?
"I watched a video about an OLX scammer, your voice sounds like his!"
It must've been me then... I could be that fraud.
"Really?!?
- Yeah, I'm the fraud.
Don't tell me? Are you serious?"
"You're the one who's saying it, not me.
- I saw that video, will you really scam me? It'll really hurt me."
"Yes, I'm that fraud."
"Should I not marry again then? Because if you scam me, she'll divorce me too!"
"Bro, listen to me. I don't have time for BS."
You don't have time? You're calling people and scamming them!
"BRO, WHAT DID I LOOT FROM YOU?"
"You were about to!
- WHAT DID I LOOT FROM YOU?"
"Sir, you're from the Army, why are you talking like this?"
"BUT YOU CALLED ME A SCAMMER, DID I SCAM YOU?"
"Sir, it seems you've forgotten your Army discipline.
- TELL ME, WHAT DID I TAKE?"
You've lost your composure...
TALK TO ME NICELY!
But I've been respectful throughout...
BUT YOU TALKED ABOUT SCAMMING!
Then why were you sending a QR code?
LISTEN TO ME! WHY DO YOU CARE IF I GIVE MY DEBIT CARD TO SOMEONE ELSE OR NOT?
"Why were you sending a QR code request?
- THAT'S HOW I'LL PAY YOU!"
DO YOU WANT IT OR NOT?
"Will it be deposited or withdrawn from my account?
- THIS IS HOW IT'S DONE!"
"Have some patience Bro, otherwise people will realise you're a scammer.
- THIS IS HOW IT'S DONE!"
DON'T TAKE THE RENT ADVANCE IF YOU DON'T WANT IT! WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? 
"DON'T TAKE IT THEN!
- Then how will you make money?"
IT'S OK IF I DON'T MAKE MONEY. YOU DON'T WORRY.
"If you talk nicely, people won't realise you're a scammer."
"PUT THE PHONE DOWN!
- No, no, you're an Army Officer. "
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?
"Sir, please don't get mad at me."
"I DON'T HAVE TIME. CALL BACK LATER!
- Don't get angry, you're an Army Officer."
"I'M NOT GETTING ANGRY. CALL ME BACK LATER.
- Why are you being rude?"
DON'T YOU GET IT? CALL ME BACK LATER!
"Sir, please listen to me.
- CALL ME BACK LATER. I HEARD YOU!"
"Don't get mad at me.
- I'M NOT ANGRY. CALL ME BACK LATER."
"Sir, please listen, let's finish the deal.
- WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?"
"Sir, what happened?
Why are you so angry?
- YOU TELL, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?"
"No problem, but you're getting angry. You're an Army Officer, I'm getting scared."
"BROTHER, CALL ME LATER!"
But you're not even finishing the deal!
WE'LL TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING LATER! HAVE SOME PATIENCE.
"But you're an Army Officer, I have to give you priority."
"DON'T DO ANYTHING!
JUST PUT THE PHONE DOWN!
DO YOU WANT ME TO SWEAR?"
"Sir, you're an Army Officer, I don't mind you swearing at me."
PLEASE PUT THE PHONE DOWN!
"Because I respect you, Sir.
- YES. BUT IT'S NOT GOOD TO SWEAR. HANG UP!"
Then why were you talking about swearing?
HANG UP OR I'LL SWEAR AT YOU!
"Don't worry, I'll be ok."
JUST LEAVE IT. HANG UP.
"Sir, why are you scamming people?
- WHY ARE YOU WASTING MY TIME?"
You're scamming people even though you're an Army Officer!
"YOUR MOTHER'S P*SSY! F**KER!
I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU TO HANG UP MOTHERF**KER!"
"DO YOU LIKE PEOPLE SWEARING AT YOU, MOTHERF**KER?"
CUT THE CALL!!!
Are these the only 4 swear words you know?
" ARE YOU GETTING IT???
- You are getting money from scamming people."
GET LOST F**KER.
"So, what did we learn today?"
Write it in the comments.
Stay safe and long live India.
"But the thing is, he is refusing to talk to you, telling that you are a motherf*cker."
Congratulations! I have successfully wasted your time!
"India, these b*stard phone scammers are targeting you guys now too. Have a listen to this call"
It's one of my subscribers. He's an Indian studying in Germany.
And this is a huge scam being run against Indians studying
overseas and listen for the very very fine Hindi used at the end of this call.
This is scammer revenge.
"How good was that, guys? He literally took the scammer on his daily commute around"
Hamburg and wasted all this time. And if you're wondering how do they get your information? There are two ways.
Firstly when you upload your CV to a job website
"they just go there and download it. Your CV has your name, your address, and your phone number and"
"Secondly, they can buy your data from the person who helped organize your VISA. After your VISAs done"
these people don't have a relationship with two anymore.
So they on-sell your data. And now share this video with all your friends who are studying overseas
They need to know about this scam if you want to support the work that I do
hit that join button become a Rock Army member so I can keep creating content here in
Incredible India so I can keep busting these scammers.
We don't want scammers. Long Live India.

i'm gonna be calling a scam call center
that is pretending to work for amazon
these dirty rats try to convince their
victims into thinking that they have
accidentally purchased an iphone through
their amazon account
they basically want you to say that you
didn't place that order and you would
like to cancel it then they will begin
to direct you onto their website where
they will ask you to type in all your
personal information
and a credit card so they could update
your amazon account
of course the website they will direct
you to is not
amazon in fact it's their own website
where they will now steal
all the information that you provide to
them okay so with the explanation out of
the way let's give these losers a call
and give them a headache i'll be calling
pretending to be an old man who knows
nothing about technology and also has
terrible hearing
as you can see here scammers steal more
money from the elderly than
any other age group that's why they are
more willing to stay on the phone
and not give up as easily when they get
a senior on the phone

payday

"Attention, homeowner."
"We are calling you from
investigation team of IRS."
"I'm calling in reference
to your student loan."
[robocall in Mandarin].
"You will be taken under
custody by the local police."
"We sincerely congratulate you on the
grand prize winnings of 3.5"
million U.S. dollars.
We all get robocalls.
"They're relentless, annoying."
They're often illegal.
They're costing consumers millions.
"And last month, Americans
received a record-breaking 5.7"
"billion of them. If they are
making billions of calls and getting"
"thousands of people to answer to trickle
down to dozens of victims every"
"day, it's an absolute epidemic."
"There is millions and millions
of dollars being lost."
"To date the FTC has filed
145 cases alleging telemarketing violations."
"The problem is so big that the
government and all four major U.S."
"carriers are doing
something about it."
"And it's even created a new market
for hundreds of smaller companies that"
focus solely on stopping the scams.
"Why has there been such an uptick
in robocalls and what's being done to"
protect us now and into the future?
"Robocalls can really be any
kind of pre-recorded message."
"It'll usually come from
an unknown number."
There are good robocalls.
"Things like schools and
police and fire, right?"
"We've got to let those
through. Everybody wants those calls."
"Then there's those middle calls that
are things like collections agencies,"
"right? Debt collectors,
legal telemarketers."
"According to the YouMail robocall index,
October saw 2,115 robocalls every"
"second, 30 million more each day than
in September, totaling 49 billion so"
"far this year. A majority were
legal robocalls: think alerts, payment"
"reminders and
legitimate telemarketers."
But 47 % were scams.
"So how are scammers actually
making these illegal calls?"
"You buy a list of leads, you plug
it into this computer, you spin up a"
"call center. The risk of getting caught
is almost zero and the reward is"
"millions and millions of
dollars every single year."
"And these calls appear
in ever-more creative ways."
"In October, the most popular
scams involved health, interest rates,"
"student loans, Social
Security and warranties."
"You'll receive a free five-day,
four-night magical Orlando getaway."
"Either a too-good-to-be-true scenario
or a fear-based scenario."
"So yes, people's fears would be
something wrong with their existing bank"
"account. Another fear would be
involved in a federal agency."
So the IRS type of scam.
"This call is to inform you that
IRS is filing lawsuit against you."
"It might be a grandchild that's calling
you up and saying that they are"
"trapped overseas and they
lost their wallet."
They call it the grandparents scam.
"There's something called the Jamaican lottery
scam where they tell the"
"consumer that they've won, you know, 500,000
or a million dollars in a"
"lottery, but they just need
to pay a processing fee."
"[robocall in Mandarin] A new robocall scam
comes in Chinese and they are"
actually targeting Asian-Americans.
"They try to basically dupe them into
paying some type of money for a"
"purported immigration failure
or paperwork failure."
"There are number neighbors scams which
trick you into answering by making"
"it appear the caller shares the
first six digits of your number."
"Faking numbers like this
is called spoofing."
Spoofing numbers is incredibly easy.
"So the caller I.D.,"
"you could set it to
be anything you want."
"There is no real
phone number anymore."
"They can basically spoof any phone number
so they can spoof the IRS' phone"
"number. They can spoof the
Social Security Administration's phone number,"
a business' phone number.
"Or they're calling from Microsoft to go
and say that your computer has a"
"virus, right? They will try every trick in
the book to get you to be"
"scared and to give them money
in order to fix the problem."
"But how do scammers
get your phone number?"
"Every time that you sign up for a
free service, whether it is the phone"
"company, an app, or maybe you use your
phone number in a retail store to"
"get coupons or build up a point
system, we're giving out that information"
"and it's up to us as the consumers
to say, what are you doing with that"
"information? Do you sell it
to a third party?"
"Or often times they're dialing random
numbers until someone picks up."
"There's a whole criminal enterprise around
that creates lists of numbers"
"that are active. So if you've ever
gotten a call from an unknown number,"
"you pick it up
and there's nobody there."
"That could be one of these services that
are checking to see if your phone"
is active and being used.
"On average every single person in
the United States gets 1.3"
robocalls every single day.
"With advances in phone technology, so
too came the rise of robocalling."
"Roughly around the 80s the telephone
system changed from analog to"
"digital. And now anybody can kind of
go and plug into the phone system."
"So this has been great
because we get wireless phones."
We get low-cost calling.
"We have Skype, we have WhatsApp."
"But the negative side to that, right,
the dark side to that is that"
"scammers can go and jump on there,
partner up with a shady phone carrier"
"and start blasting out millions and
millions of calls with pre-recorded"
"messages. In 2018, the FCC got
more than 230,000 complaints about unwanted"
"calls, up 25 % from 2017, making it
by far the largest single complaint it"
"receives. When it comes to who falls
for the scams, there's an interesting"
"trend. The Better Business Bureau found last
year that people age 18 to 24"
"were actually more than twice as
susceptible to robocalls as people over"
"age 65. Although the average older consumer
lost more than four times the"
"money. And that's the simple answer to
why robocalls are on the rise."
Criminals are making millions.
"In one famous case, a Florida man
made 96 million spoofed calls in just"
"three months in 2016, trying to
sell victims vacations from well-known"
"travel companies. I'm not the kingpin
of robocalling that is alleged."
The FCC was able to identify Mr.
"Abramovitch. They imposed a $120
million fine on him."
"There's been a recent flurry of
success in catching and prosecuting"
illegal robocallers.
"After Abramovich's record-setting fine last
year, the FCC fined another"
"robocaller $82 million and proposed
another fine of $37.5"
"million. And the Department of Justice
arrested 24 people who were helping"
"one India based call center
defraud thousands of U.S."
"residents out of hundreds
of millions of dollars."
"The callers were sentenced with up
to 20 years in jail."
Text message scams are also illegal.
"A precedent set by a $10 million
settlement in 2009 with a company that"
"sent 60,000 unsolicited
advertisement texts."
"The customer doesn't trust
the phone anymore."
"There's a complete lack of trust in the
phone system and we have to get"
"that back. The good news is
detection is now readily available."
"We might see a new number that we've
never seen before all of a sudden"
"start pumping out tons
and tons of calls."
"And so while you can go and hide,
try and hide your tracks, you can't hide"
those patterns. All four major U.S.
"cell carriers now offer some
form of detection and blocking."
"We were the first to implement
a network-based scam detection and we"
"actually identify if a call is a
scam and then we actually change the"
"caller I.D. So instead of the person's
name, you see the word Scam Likely."
"And we didn't make people download
an app or take any action."
"And that Scam Likely label has
gained a lot of popularity."
We've seen t-shirts printed with it.
"There's a Scam Likely
beer that's been made."
"T-mobile has a more stringent set
of filters available for $3.99"
"a month and another free option that
stops scam calls from coming in at"
"all. And since we've started in March
of 2017, we've flagged over 15"
billion calls as Scam Likely.
"Verizon's program is opt-in
instead of automatic."
"Customers download a free Call Filter
app which sends known scam calls"
"straight to voicemail and a premium
version is available for $2.99"
"a month. What we're doing beyond that
is making sure that we're working"
"with federal lawmakers, the FCC and
other carriers and partners to make"
"sure that we start blocking these at
the network level itself, so the"
calls won't even reach you.
"At Sprint, customers also opt in,
enrolling in free basic spam detection"
or $2.99 a month Premium Caller I.D.
"AT&T recently added fraud blocking and
suspected spam alerts to millions"
"of lines, making it
automatic for new customers."
"And then there's a growing number of
apps and third party services focused"
entirely on solving this problem.
"Between 2016 and 2018, you've seen a
growth in smartphone apps alone from"
"about 85 in 2016 to
north of 500 in 2018."
Nomorobo is one popular app.
"It's free for landline
protection and $1.99"
"a month for mobile. If you get
your phone service from your cable company"
"or Vonage or Ooma or any kind of
those, our service is available and we're"
"analyzing millions and millions of
calls every single month."
"Every day we add 1,500
new numbers to our blacklist."
"Our blacklist is over
2 million known robocallers."
"Another popular service is YouMail,
a voicemail management service that"
also blocks robocalls.
"And companies like First Orion, Hiya
and TNS Call Guardian partner with"
"carriers to offer
blocking and labeling."
"And antivirus company NortonLifeLock
recently finished an education"
"campaign teaching 17,000 law enforcement about
how to spot the most common"
"scams and help those
who call in complaints."
"There's also a new popular
homegrown approach: scam the scammers."
"So you said you were
trying to make a payment?"
I'm just a little shook up.
"I actually had like an
alien encounter this morning."
"This tactic takes up valuable time the
scammers may have used to make"
"other phony calls. You can pay an
app called RoboKiller to do this for"
"you. For $2.99 a month, its answer
bots will drive the spammers nuts from"
any of the almost 1.3
"million scam call numbers
on its list."
"And there's one more big player in
the robocall prevention space: the U.S."
"government. Robocalls to non-consenting individuals
were outlawed by the"
"Telephone Consumer Protection
Act in 1991."
"Violators are charged between $500
and $1500 per legal call."
"In one huge class action verdict, the
scammers are paying $925 million in"
"damages. Another recent settlement cost
the robocaller $76 million."
"Each class member will get
approximately $250 per call."
"Many class members received tens, some
received hundreds of calls, which"
"is quite a large
recovery for telephone calls."
"Spoofing has been illegal since 2009, when
the FCC passed the Truth in"
"Caller I.D. Act. And this year,
Congress passed two more laws."
"The TRACED Act passed out of the Senate by
a vote of 97 to one and the"
"Stopping Bad Robocalls Act passed out of the
House by a vote of 429 to"
"three. Both bills require carrier
participation in a program called"
"SHAKEN/STIR, which verifies the calling number
and helps trace the origin"
"of the call, although it won't determine
whether the call is legal or a"
"scam. Rupy also helped start a new
traceback program in hopes of catching"
"more scammers. There are about 30
different companies participating in the"
"effort. They will identify suspicious or
illegal traffic and they will"
"select a small sampling of these
calls and trace these calls back."
"In September, California passed a
new stringent Consumer Call Protection"
"Act of 2019, shifting the burden
of compliance to service providers"
instead of the callers themselves.
"And in August, all 50 State
Attorney Generals and 12 voice providers"
"signed onto eight
new anti-robocall principles."
The government can't do it alone.
"We must have our friends in the private
industry to step up to the plate"
and to block these illegal robocalls.
"But for now, the number
of calls is only growing."
"We are dealing with a very
crafty adversary and as mitigation efforts"
"improve, they will change
their tactics almost certainly."
So what can we as consumers do?
"Don't answer numbers that
you don't recognize, right?"
"Don't believe what the
caller is saying."
"And whatever you do, do not
pay for anything over the phone."
"And register your number on the
Federal Trade Commission's official Do Not"
"Call registry. By signing up, you're
protected from certain legal forms of"
"robocalls, and it's enforced."
"In 2017, for example, Dish Network was
fined $280 million for making calls"
to people on the list.
"There are a large universe of
legitimate telemarketers that honor that"
list and follow that list.
"And eventually, experts agree that we
will see a radical decrease in"
robocalls. People are listening.
It is a bipartisan issue.
"Everyone is annoyed by this
and legislation is being enacted."
"If we all do it
well, scammers will give up."
It will not be profitable for them.
"They will stop. We're making it more
difficult for the robocallers to get"
their message out.
So what are they going to do?
Make more calls.
"In the short term, it's
actually going to get worse."
"But the long term: now that we've
proven that robocall blocking is a"
"thing, it works, it's reliable, I think
this is just going to become a"
"basic feature of every phone
and every phone carrier."
"And hopefully in a couple of years,
we're going to forget about this"
problem.
"This is the final
attempt to reach you."
Press one now.

screen you'll get an
connection from amazon for department
you need to allow yourself so that we
can go ahead and cancel your order okay
so just give a click on i am aware of
the call and then give a click on accept
or also if
my motive was to do anything wrong with
you i would not have sent you any
security warning on your screen
if anything goes wrong while being on a
call with us you can just report it to
the better business bureau no issue sir
is in a call center in kolkata located
in the east indian region of west bengal
they are running an amazon refund scam
and are one of the dirtiest call centers
when it comes to spying methods and
silently stealing from victims by using
their devices when the victim
leaves it unattended i've been watching
these guys for a few weeks now
and even made a video on them before if
you haven't seen that video i recommend
watching it first so you better
understand what i'm going to show you
today
after that video of shutting down some
of their machines with malware
they continue their scams very quickly
the next day i re-spread my access
through the network to the connections
that i lost and continue monitoring
their scams
hello we are checking in our server that
you have made
a purchase of iphone 11
2l worth rupees 1499
so you want to accept the order or want
to cancel the order
okay you have one to cancel the order we
will provide you a cancellation form
just fill it up
and your order will be cancelled oh sir
oh just we will take your five to ten
minutes to cancel or
just you have to sit in front of your
computer or laptop we will
give you a cancellation form when the
scammer asks this question
if the victim has a computer or phone
there's three roads the scam can take
from here
the first option is that the victim says
that they do not have a computer or
phone
and usually when they say this other
scammers that i've watched in the past
give up so first of all let me know one
thing ma'am do you have a computer or a
laptop
even you don't have a laptop or uh you
don't have a smartphone
okay so this call is not for you okay
these cameras though
are very persistent and have adapted to
the fact that some people don't own
technology for them to take remote
access of for the following clip i'm
going to show you
we are going to listen to the senior
manager on the floor who can be
identified by his deep
and distinguishable voice whenever an
agent in the call center gets close to
scamming a victim
he walks over to their computer and
takes over the call to finish the
business
how do you check it do you do any kinds
of online banking okay
let me tell you it will not reflect in
your banking statement
right now it will reflect after 48 hours
because it's a 3d payment so after 48
hours if you come to us
we will be able to help you so now as
you don't have any kinds of device
so i cannot send you the money online
okay
into your bank because you don't even do
online banking
all right so what i'll be doing is i'll
be giving you the money
in the form of gift card so that you can
collect the cash
no sir after this call disconnects we'll
we cannot hold up the money i'll
i'll explain you everything you can take
me as your grandson what the scammer
said there
take me as your grandson is one of the
many little things he keeps saying
during calls with victims he tries to
put them at ease by saying stuff like
take me as your grandson
i will be here with you throughout the
whole process don't worry take a deep
breath
calm down at the same time though he
also puts a lot of pressure on the
victim in a non-aggressive way
by saying it has to be done within 48
hours and that if the victim hangs up
the phone
he will lose all of his money all this
plays a huge factor in the success rate
of scammers
and this specific guy was verbally
strong and had a deep voice which is
scientifically proven to make people
trust you easier it's not a surprise why
he
is a higher up in this company and why
he gets to scam a lot of people
successfully as well
just let me know one thing that do you
drive yeah so that you can collect the
cash
so do you have a nearest walmart or a
cvs pharmacy or
a family dollar or a dollar general you
live close to the walmart
okay and for all security reasons before
the money was taken out
what was the last balance you had on
your card
before the money was taken out so that
we can mark you as safe
calm down calm down take a deep breath
i'm there with you don't panic
okay just give me a rough count like is
it more than thousand or less than
thousand the scammer asks the victim
how much money is in his account so that
he knows how much he can steal from him
they will always try to get as much
money per victim as possible
and usually try to rip the victim off
for their entire savings account the old
man
initially replies that his debit card
has about 200 on it which
in the scammer's eyes is not enough
money to steal from him and you bank
with only
one bank or you bank with any other
bankrolls
what was the last balance you remember
on the second bank
now let me tell you those hackers have
overdrafted your that bank
okay which which had 800 dollars so they
have taken out your 800
plus they have over drafted it your
account is a minus 1500 so don't worry
i'm giving you your money back so
what i'll do is on your second bank
which has which you just now told me
with the balance of 800 i'm adding up a
credit line
of a thousand dollars are you getting me
and that's that's a credit line
which you have to use in the walmart and
purchase
apple gift card for a 500 yes with not
your money sir
because you don't have any money right
now i have added a credit line
and i'll be there with you unless and
until you receive your cash
so don't worry you can take me as your
son it's your own hard-earned money
right
i do believe you want your money back
luckily this victim did not fall
for the supposed credit line that was
added to his card and hung up the phone
not everyone is as cautious as this man
though
these cameras were actually quite
successful at scamming people
especially when the victims did own a
device that the scammers could take
remote access off this brings me back to
our game tree
the second and third option are that the
victim does admit to having either a
phone
or a computer the phone method is very
similar to that of not having any device
the scammer will simply try to steal
money from the victims payment apps like
that from bank of america
cash app paypal and many more and the
zell is the application through which
this hackers have used
means okay we'll transfer you the funds
okay so just go ahead and write down
the cell phone number of the sender
first
over here no no no this is our billing
manager number
whom you will send the request then he
will send you the funds
okay go give a click on send
yeah give a click on send money to this
give a click on it you're sending the
request money as you could see
the scammer was pretending like it was a
money request even though it clearly
said
send money the victim complied but
because all of our balances were
negative the payments didn't go through
one of our accounts even had a balance
of minus nine hundred thousand dollars
which i had never seen before
scammer then tried the same sole payment
method with this email
and also with this email i reported all
this information to zell and they took
down the accounts for me
they tried to steal money from several
different apps like bank of america
wells fargo american express and her
paypal after 45 minutes of messing
around
they finally gave up this particular
victim did not have any money and the
scammers weren't very happy with this
listen to me you're all the accounts are
closed and your accounts are corrupted
in this
i'm adding a thousand dollar credit line
which you have to use
and purchase the gift card with our
money go back and swipe your screen down
mom [ __ ] you ma'am go back to your
paypal
okay now swipe your thumb i mean
just scroll the page down mom open the
paypal
how much balance do you have in this one
nothing
okay nothing
nothing okay like you don't have any
money in any of your cards right
it's zero wonderful right and how much
how much credit is available on this e e
n inc
30 or 40.
i called the victim up to let her know
everything about the scam and that the
scammers could still spy on her with the
any desk and teamviewer application that
they made her install
through the app store about they're
trying to steal your money they're not
actually from amazon
they are located in india in a scam call
center and they're trying to steal your
money
yeah okay good thank you i mean i
thought i knew that but i guess i
didn't if anyone ever calls you from a
big company like amazon
social security like asking you for gift
cards asking you for access to your
devices no it's a scam
thank you so much thank you very much oh
my god i'm really grateful thank you the
computer method is the same as most
other refund scams
i'm not going to waste too much time
showcasing this because i already
analyzed this method in my last video
but just to give you a very quick run
through
they have this refund portal which i
found on most of their computers the
victim has to fill out their information
once they have to type the refund amount
the scammer types an extra zero
and pretends like the victim made that
mistake and now has to give the money
back to the scammers made a mistake
so you have to you know refund the money
back to us
you can take 1500 and the rest of the
money you can refund us back
and can you tell me like how far is your
bank from your home
this particular victim was an 86 year
old lady that could not pay the scammers
back
because she did not have a cell phone
she could not drive to a store or a bank
and she was physically disabled so she
couldn't even walk like what is the
problem what is the major issue like why
[Music]
[Music]
86 year old disabled lady and they still
tried for one hour and 48 minutes to get
money from her through her laptop
for this they tried several different
websites like moon pay binance coinbase
and moneygram
but none of them seemed to really
satisfy them but then they realized that
the woman had a webcam
and they said this
[Music]
would packs perfect for them they could
steal the victim's identity through her
laptop webcam
and register an account with her debit
card linked to the account to empty your
savings account luckily she wasn't a
blocked jurisdiction
so paxful didn't work scammers didn't
know what to do at this point and were
even struggling to complete a simple
puzzle to prove they weren't robots
you have to slide slide the puzzle you
know yeah
yeah leave your mouse okay in your mouth
do not touch your mouth
hello you have to move the puzzle in the
middle okay now stop
stop after almost two hours the victim
was rightfully getting impatient
and mad at the scammers but they were
just laughing at her
ma'am is there any cell phone with you
like
in your family member
okay okay okay just keep calm and relax
all right hold on at this point the
scammers were so desperate to steal
something from the victim
that one of them even tried to buy
himself a phone plan which revealed his
real phone number to me of course she
tried to buy the most expensive pack
with the victim's money she kept saying
that she was going to hang up
but she ended up never doing it i
decided to shut down her computer from
the scammer's end while they were not at
the computer and at that point i could
call the victim and warn her about the
scam
and she wasn't very happy with me
calling either hey hear me man
yeah yeah i just wanted to warn you the
guys you have been talking to for the
past
two hours are trying to scam you what
they were trying to steal money from
from you through your uh laptop they
were trying to sign you up with all
all types of crypto companies and trying
to steal your money
thanks now
who actually are these scammers during
the weeks that i was watching them
i found some clues on the identity of
these cameras the first thing i found
was an alliance broadband
voip portal registered on the real name
of one of the scammers his full name
as you can see is sanji he is probably
one of the higher ups in the company
since he pays the bills for their call
center which we can see from this
invoice this webpage
also reveals the scam call center's
exact address and is located in a tower
on joppur garden number 214
in kolkata west bengal india the second
clue i found
i was one of the scammers always coming
in early into the call center before
everyone else's shift started
he was always on one of the computers
doing work on something called
srt fb append he was adding categories
to wikipedia pages for some money i was
doing this work
with his real name in the logs of the
computer he always worked on
i found the email address and password
for this srt app and web page
and also his personal gmail account with
his personal password his name
as you can see from his email is the
other two pieces of information i found
were two phone numbers one that we saw
earlier when the scammer tried
purchasing himself a phone plan
and one other number that i found when
one of the bosses of this operation
opened his whatsapp web he did this to
try and download a file that somebody
else sent him that was called
usa fresh old age with 86 000 people in
the list that were at least 75 years old
and potential scam victims the
information in a list
included stuff like their full name
email address phone number their home
address and much more information on the
potential victims
now that we have all that information
about the scammers and their scams
let's do some destructive work i'm going
to start off the destruction by
completely shutting down their phone
system
and corrupting all the settings in the
admin portal for the phone settings to
accomplish this i did the following
things to their phone system for the
report section
i messed up the settings in their
visibox which corrupts their entire
phone system
i then deleted all user accounts which
makes it impossible for the scammers to
log in and continue scamming i then
deleted all their calling campaigns
statuses hotkeys leads auto-odd dials
and acc ids which stops their robocalls
and deletes all the settings of these
robocalls on the list section i then
deleted all their lists
i deleted all their scripts on the
script section i deleted all their
filters
and for the inbound section i deleted
their showing groups their dids
their call menus and their filter phone
groups then finally for the remote
agents i deleted all the remote agents i
deleted the extension groups
in the admin section i changed all the
passwords for the login to the user
accounts and to the admin account so the
admins cannot log into the admin account
to restore the settings then i changed
their call times their shifts
i deleted their phones their templates
their carriers their servers and their
conferences and then messed up the
system settings
i deleted all the system statuses i
added a voicemail which warns victims
and somehow might still get through when
calling the number which i don't think
is possible and i also changed their
whole music to the same thing
now let's see what the scammers thought
of this corrupt system hello
hello you are an eagle
bye
[Music]
this side can't be reached
and now it's time to destroy the
computers in this call center with the
nj alarm screen locker malware
and change all the scammers their
backgrounds to the fbi logo to freak
them out
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
foreign
after this the scammers started to argue
because they thought somebody in their
middle betrayed them
foreign
and after this the scammers never
returned if you liked the video

[Music]

[Music]
"Yeah, Mr Rohit camera seems to be fine."
"Sir, can you hold the line for a moment, please?"
Yeah okay.
"So, I posted an ad on OLX to sell my camera and this guy wants to buy it."
He claims that he's an army officer and has also sent me an ID.
But I still have a doubt that he's a scammer because didn't negotiate the price
and just wants to but the camera without even looking at it.
"So, I have a doubt but I also want to see how he will scam me. so let's see."
"Yeah sir, so how should we finalize the deal?"
"Yeah, I liked the camera. I'll send you the advance."
"But sir, don't prefer meeting once before just buying the camera and"
I can meet you also because meeting an army officer isn't very common.
"Mr Rohit, you're right but my posting is outstation."
"So, it won't be possible for us to meet"
but I liked your camera and I don't want someone else buying this so I'll send you the advance.
Alright.
"So, tell me one thing, how will you pay the amount?"
"I'll do one thing, I'll send you a QR code,"
you scan that and you'll receive the amount right away.
QR code. But why are you sending a QR code?
What if I scan it and you empty my bank account?
"Mr Rohit, I'm an army officer. I'll never do that."
"Okay. Do one thing, instead of scanning the QR code,"
I'll send you my account details.
You send the money through that.
That's a long procedure.
First I'll have to add your bank account then wait for the activation.
"I'm sending you the QR code, scan it and you'll receive the payment"
"and if I was scamming you, I would've asked for a pin or an OTP."
All I'm asking you to do is just to scan the QR code.
Listen to me.
I know about this new scam and this has happened with my friend once.
I don't know if it was you or someone else but I know about this.
"Because I know, as soon as I'll scan the code,"
you'll empty my bank account.
"Now, how you do that is a different thing, but this is happening a lot."
And at least have some shame.
You guys are scamming people under the name of Indian Army.
"This is ridiculous, seriously."
Why are you doing this?
"When you know how things are right now and how people are managing their income right now,"
you guys are scamming everyone and ruining their lives.
"Now, why aren't you saying anything?"
"Now that I've caught you, tell me?"
"Look, this is our work."
You got lucky. There are other fishes in the pond.
And this won't stop.
I don't know what to say.
How much do you guys earn by scamming people?
"Well, earlier it used to be easy money but now people are more aware"
and now this pandemic.
"So, right now we make 5-6 lakhs every month."
5-6 lakhs and you feel that this is less?
Dude stop all this.
Why are you guys stealing people's hard-earned money?
Stop your teaching.
I'll scan your phone and empty your account right now.
"So, you'll hack my phone?"
Yes.
"Dude listen, the phone I'm using to talk to you"
has no apps or any information related to my bank account
and I don't even use the internet.
This phone is empty. I'm not a fool.
"So, even if you hack my phone you won't get anything."
"So, you forget about this and I have recorded"
all the conversation and I will post this on social media.
By doing this I'll help people get knowledge
about scammers like you because the police won't do anything.
At least people should know about such scams.
Hahaha.
You post it wherever you want to.
"You couldn't be scammed, but we have many other stupid people in our country."
"If this trick doesn't work, we'll find a new way."
But we won't stop.
Whatever seems to be right for you dude.
What else can I say?
These scammers will never stop.
"Actually, this has happened to my friend."
What happened was that
he posted an ad on OLX to sell his phone and
there was a buyer who said he's in the Indian Army
and wants to buy the phone without negotiating much.
He was ready to buy it without even looking at it
and said he's posted somewhere else
and also sent his ID.
"My friend thought it's a normal thing,"
he's paying the advance amount also.
"So, he sent a QR code to my friend."
My friend knew that after scanning the code a pin has to be entered to proceed to pay.
"So, after scanning the code, he received 10rs which was sent by the"
scammer as a trial for my friend to check
if the amount is transferring or not.
"So, my friend received 10rs after scanning the code"
and my friend thought he's not a scammer as he received the money.
"As soon as the scammer sends the QR code to my friend,"
his whole bank account was wiped out.
All the money was gone.
How that happened he still doesn't know.
It's a new scam.
How the money was gone without even putting a pin number.
He even registered a complaint in the bank.  Nothing has happened until now.
But how the money was wiped out without putting a pin
"or an OTP, I have no clue."
"So, I would suggest you"
to never scan any QR code to receive money
because this has happened with my friend and many others.
"So, please be aware."
"If you have to receive money from someone,"
give them your account number or UPI id.
Don't scan the QR code.
"So, please be aware because your safety is in your hands."
I'll see you next week and please be aware of this scam.
Thank you.

learn
i'm trying to understand have you seen
the videos about
marquissimo

lucky enough

a lot of people stepped up and helped
him but he took that decision he made
that decision himself

much time do you have
two months what's gonna happen in two

salt but look
i just want to say something to you
human to human
and i don't really know what the words
are yet i just wanna i just wanna
try to connect with you
on an emotional level okay this isn't
about the words this isn't about
the scam this isn't about anything other
than i'm a person
and you're a person on this planet now i
firmly believe
that people should take responsibility
and accountability
for the things that they do and the
mistakes that they make
so i don't approve of this at all but
i also believe people can be in really
shitty situations
make wrong decisions and then they can
right those wrongs
you have every power
to change this i know it doesn't feel
like it right now
and i know you were dealt a shitty hand
you have it way harder than i do i get
that completely i'm not saying it's just
as
easy or hard but your life is in your
hands
you can make decisions for yourself
nobody else
you can make this right
you understand that
i do how old are you
i'm about to be 24. dude you are
it's 23 now you are so
young it's heartbreaking to see you on
this path when you are literally in the
prime of your life you can do
anything you want to do you just have to
bust your ass and want it bad enough
if you stay in this you are going to be
stuck here
you're going to just go deeper in the
hole digging yourself deeper
making things worse you're going to get
into more debt you're going to be in
with more bad people
and you are going to either die in this
call center or
die in a prison cell you need to make a
change
now right now
do you understand
[Music]
yes i can help you until the cows come
home but it's not going to matter
unless it's what you want and you need
to make it happen
if you could see face to face like i
have
the tears in a woman's eyes an elderly
grandmother who's just had her entire
life ripped away from her
it it changes you it makes you
if you could see that there's just no
way a human being can see that
and not want to change i understand that
you just gotta [ __ ] do it man
all right
just do it yes just do it
it's that's that simple what do i call
you what's your name
make up a name but what do i call you

[Music]
[Music]
hello everyone and hello trilogy media
this is toby
how i end up being a scammer in my life
it was not happened intentionally
first of all i didn't knew that it was a
scam call center
before i got stuck there
[Music]
i'm gonna let you guys know which and
everything in detail
when i completed my 12th standard
at the same time my dad was an asthma
person he's no more now he's normal with
us
while we were having this treatment we
were
facing a very hard time so there are
some
small small organizations where we can
get loan
which you have to pay them with an
interest so
my mom started taking loans
[Music]
his sickness could increase day by day
he was the only hope for us it was the
one was looking
after our family or in so much debt that
if i calculate everything then it will
be around four legs
which we have to pay them back now that
is the
reason why after after i complete my 12
i could not able to study no longer
because of the dead
just when i was looking for a college to
get admitted for my further study
all these things came up i mean all the
depths and all i was
not able to study any longer so i
started looking for jobs and you know
other places very
difficult to find at this kind of job
you don't have
big companies or you can get job there's
no big private company and talking about
the government jobs it's very rare it's
very hard to get
after some days after he expired i got a
job
in a shop it was a repairing shop
where i was working as a technician
i earned some money if i was getting
like uh
5 000 in a month so that's how i
got admitted in the institution where i
get my
certificate for that repairing as a
technician
computer technician i was working
that was not enough for my living and
for
to pay back all the debts one suddenly
my friend came up while i was in the
shop he
told me about the call center and all
like in a big big city
i don't need any qualification to get a
job there
for example if you can speak english
that's more enough for them to get
you selected during the uh in your
organization
at first i didn't know that it was a
scam for call center
you told me then you can come with us i
have a job there
or you can get around 20 to 25 rupees if
you're lucky enough then you'll get like
30 000 rupees in a month so i was so
excited
i thought that finally i will be able to
help my mom i'll be
able to clear all her debts and also
that we can
at least we can live peacefully
[Music]
on the first day of my work when i
joined here
they didn't ask me anything they just
asked me my name
what i do how much i've studied that was
the only question that they asked after
that
i got selected in this uh this call
center
i never did any interview in my life
that was my first interview first job
interview and
i got selected i was so excited i
started working they
provided us some script and all going
for one week
i came to know that it's a scream call
center
software i tried to leave the job
first of all so i started looking for a
job
i went to some big company to apply to
do interview but i did not get selected
i tried try it
life is very hard out there in city in
metro city
you cannot survive with 10 to 15 000
eggs even very hard to get
a job they need a high qualification
person so to get
those kind of job that's kind of legit
though so most of the people from the
northeast
i'm not saying that everyone is doing
that everyone needs a scam or everyone's
working in this gameshop scandal center
there's a few people who are
who work in a legit company
[Music]
this is my house this is the kitchen
this is the walls
this is the bed
[Music]
this is another room
we'll fill up some
[Music]
some appearing philosophy here
this is another room of one bed
[Music]
this is the second room
[Music]
this is the third room the electricity
is a little dim
so i turn on my place
[Music]
this is the third room
[Music]
this is how we are living
[Music]
this is the wall
[Music]

[Music]
this is the hardware
[Music]
this is what it looked like from the
outside
[Music]
this is the jackfruit tree
this is the get
most of the houses are same here in my
[Music]
place
i worked for almost uh six months
[Music]
uh when the six months started the last
month
and i was working i met
ashton and art i met him in
a live stream
when we started talking he told me
like each and everything about them like
how they helped those
previous two person to get out of the
uh the call center this game goes into
i really trust them and i believe them
i told them everything what i'm facing
when i'm facing my life
how do i live and
why i'm working all this call center
right now the only
reason like i said uh i was working the
call centers just because of the debt
that i can pay back
so that i can pay back after i come
after i pay back all the debts
i was hoping to i was thinking to start
my own shop my own repairing shop
i want to say thank you to ashton and
art
for helping me to get back home and
i just want to say thanks to them this
because of them i
was able to get home today to meet my
mom
so this is my story each and everyone
thank you very much
this is the third time that we've helped
a scammer change his life now many
scammers in the past have expressed
desire to change
and every single time we listen everyone
watching this is going to have their own
opinion and that is your right our job
here is not to convince you of anything
our job is to take each step forward
with whatever information and situation
we're facing at any given time
and make the best decision we possibly
can each step of the way
from what we feel in our hearts now of
all the scammers that have expressed
remorse to us
in the past toby is only the third one
in over four years that has actually
taken the steps to communicate deliver
and keep all of his promises
the first one was marquissimo an ex-irs
scammer that dreamt of leaving the call
center
moving back to his village and running
his own print shop he has since
accomplished all of that thanks to your
support and has become a role model
for current scammers all around the
globe the second one was dybala who
similarly dreamt of leaving his dirty
work
to buy a taxi and run an honest business
out of his home village dybala left the
scam
and purchased the taxi all thanks to you
he has since faced some injury and major
hurdles in life but is carrying forward
as best as he can just like the rest of
the world a major video update on him
is dropping very soon the third is toby
there is a gofundme linked below
if you like us feel it in your heart to
help him the goal amount is enough for
him to pay off all of his debts
start fresh and get him on the right
path to starting his own legitimate
computer repair company
i've spent a lot of time talking to toby
over the last few months
and i can honestly say i consider him a
friend every time we try to help his
camera
we are inundated with opinions on both
extremes and that's okay
but at the end of the day who would we
be if we didn't
at least listen if we didn't at least
open the door
and try have you ever [ __ ] up in your
past
i know i have but i believe people
should be judged on their merits
and their intentions and we believe
second chances are deserved

the Haryana Police Headquarters to take
you guys to the press conference that
the police are holding to announce what
they've done and all the details around
it as well

about this how good is this result now I
don't know how far into the police
station I can blog but I'm going to meet
the DCP he's the one who called me but
actually I'd already announced this news
before she called me I got an anonymous
tip last night about two hours before

hello hello
thank you for calling the refund
department my name is john smith how can
i help you
you call me i am not calling you okay
i do believe that you remember that you
made a payment to our company that is
the geek squad for your computer service
no oh well my database
shows that we got an amount from your
side providing you the computer service
but right now we're unable to provide
you the services to do some technical
errors with the server of our company
so that we are requesting you to cancel
the services from your end and claim the
compensation amount of 299 dollars
[Music]
so what i need to do
you just turn on your laptop and let me
know
and i will be helping you out by
providing you the cancellation form on
your computer screen
but why i am turn on my computer a
laptop
well uh sir because our automated
banking server
has to have a computer turned on would
you like to claim your 299 dollar
compensation refund today right now yes
yes yes great well
my name is john smith i'm here to help
you with that process
it's very easy it's it's almost as easy
as making
like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
so there's just a couple quick steps
that i need you to do
the first one would be go to the fridge
and get your supplies
in this case your laptop are you in
front of your laptop
yes awesome well after that you'd have
to select whether you want crunchy or
smooth peanut butter
which one would you choose yeah
i'm sorry what you thought all right
crunchy it is
so are you using a windows or mac
computer
i'm using your mother okay i'm not
familiar with that
operating system is that um is that a
linux computer

script
all the time so what if i called them
and read the exact same script

think you've got this confused

this is john smith from the geek squad
refund department
you're john smith from geeksbud yes and
according to our records
you are entitled to a 299 dollar refund
what 299
okay well unfortunately our business is
shutting down
because a satellite crashed and you
previously paid our company 299 so would
you like to go ahead and get the refund
or would you like me to charge 299
dollars to your plastic card
why are you going to charge me if your
satellite got crashed well
if you're shutting down the business
then why are you going to charge me
well it's a good thing you asked so
according to united states law if you
give us your plastic card
and a satellite crashes we are eligible
to make you help pay for our insurance
fees
technically but we're trying to be the
better person here and give you a refund
if you'd like it
but that's totally up to you like it's
your call
no and that's i got it that you are
going to refund my money
just because you are setting down your
business but if i'm not
interested then why are you going to
charge me 290 that's what i don't
understand

don't be afraid to take chances make
mistakes and get messy because
you matter and i'll see in the next
video
scammers these days are getting trickier
and trickier and now there is a brand
new phone scam out there that everyone
should know about it's not that common
apparently but it's still pretty
interesting and I thought I'd talk about
it so in this video we're gonna go over
five common telephone scams to watch out
for
including this brand new one so first
what is this new scam you may have
already seen it mentioned in the news
it's often referred to as the can you
hear me scam and what happens is the
scammer will call your phone number and
ask a simple question it may be can you
hear me or is this the head of household
or something like that and they know
that you will answer yes to whatever
question they asked or at least they're
hoping to and simply by saying the word
yes or I agree or something like that
now they've got you wait a minute what
do you mean they got me I just said yes
that's right because this is what
happened
you see when that scammer called you
they are recording that call and they
just want you to say yes or some other
positive response so they have that
recording of you that they can use later
then they're gonna hit you with some
sort of bogus charge to your phone bill
or utility bill or something like that
for example it is possible for some
services to apply charges right through
your phone bills such as those hotlines
that you know what I'm talking about and
the reason they get the recording of you
is that they will actually edit an audio
clip of them saying something like do
you agree to this charge or whatever and
then tack on your yes response that they
had so now they have a supposed proof
recording of you agreeing to charges
that you never agreed to such as if the
phone company asks for proof that you
actually did agree to this charge or you
go to challenge it later it's a very
tricky stuff
so here's the best thing to do to avoid
this type of scam if you get a call that
asks can you hear me then obviously just
hang up immediately that's the scam but
if you aren't sure like if they say is
this whoever maybe respond by saying may
I ask who's calling and why don't say
yes or anything like that then you can
probably judge the response yourself if
they're legitimate of course most of the
time you can just tell if it's a
telemarketer or some
thing so I'd say just hang up either way
no need to even waste your time you
don't have to be nice to the
telemarketers and I'm sure you know if
you tell telemarketers in general that
you're not interested they won't leave
it at that they're gonna try to keep
bugging you to keep you talking even
though you're not interested at all so
better to just not take the risk okay so
that might be the newest scam but what
are some other ones to watch out for the
next one is the so called star 72 scam
or a call forwarding scam and this one
is another tricky one that might not
seem obvious if you don't know what's
going on for those not aware star 72 is
one of the many star codes you can type
in your phone either it's a cell phone
or a landline that will perform
different functions star 72 in
particular activates call forwarding so
when you type in star 72 then any phone
number it will then forward all calls to
your number to the other phone number
that you just typed in so in this scam
the scammer will try to get you to type
in a phone number beginning with star 72
for example they may say we were in an
accident and we need you to call an
ambulance or hospital and then give you
the code and then the phone number and
they might say oh well this star code
allows you to get directly to the doctor
or something like that meanwhile now all
your calls are gonna get forwarded to
that number there's also another one
where they say oh they're calling from
jail and they called the wrong number
and they only get one phone call can you
please call my wife or something like
that
and then they get you to type it in that
way but either way if someone asks you
to type in a star code it's a scam and
then after you do that the scammer will
give your phone number to someone who
wants to call them from like long
distance collect so you have to pay for
all those collect calls and the two
scammers can talk as much as they want
while you foot the bill because the
collect call is technically being
forwarded through you so they just use
your phone number to steal calls and
they don't have to pay for it no matter
how long distance it is so just be aware
of what star codes are and don't type
any of them in if someone tells
you to the next scam is one that is
definitely not new but people somehow
still fall for it sometimes it's the
notorious Windows support scam this is
where you'll get a random phone call
from someone who claims to be from
Microsoft or sometimes from Windows yeah
it doesn't even make sense but they'll
say something along the lines of your
computer has been sending us error
messages let me help you fix it and then
they guide you through some ridiculous
process on your computer that will show
supposed errors as proof that your
computer clearly is broken but here's
the scam part then they tell you that to
fix it you need to download a certain
program from whatever website they give
and of course it's a virus and then
after that they have full control of
your computer they're gonna log
everything you type into it and of
course use it to steal your money
so yeah Microsoft is not gonna call you
about your computer next up is a more
general type of scam which are fake bank
security calls and I thought I'd talk
about this because they are kind of
tricky because sometimes the bank or
credit card company will call you if
they suspect fraud is occurring so I
thought I'd go over how to be sure that
you're not gonna fall for this so for
example a scammer may call you and claim
to be the bank and say that your card
has a suspicious charge or something
like that
they may also leave a message saying
call back this number for the fraud
department and then before they can tell
you about it they need to verify the
credit card number which of course
involves you giving them their credit
card number so what should you do about
this what if the credit card company is
actually calling you about fraud well
what I say is anytime you get a call or
message claiming to be from the bank
always make sure you call them so go to
your bank's website and call the
official number there or the one on the
back of the card and have them just
transfer you to the correct department
you can't be sure that the person who
calls you is who they say they are or
for example if they're fake and they say
oh call our fraud Department and of
course it's not really that so you want
to make sure that you're calling
something that you know is lead
now finally I just have to quickly
mention the notorious IRS scam calls
these are pretty easy to spot and almost
always involve someone calling you from
the IRS or some other tax agency saying
that you own a bunch of taxes and if you
don't pay up you're gonna go to jail now
the important thing to know here and the
main point is that with this the IRS
does not call people without sending a
letter first
so if out of the blue you just get a
message saying oh you're gonna go to
jail if you don't pay us yeah that's
obviously a scam for something that's
serious the IRS would definitely send
you a notice via certified mail so you
wouldn't just get it lost in the mail so
there's not much more to say about that
one they're pretty obvious but just know
that the IRS in general doesn't call you
without letting you know by mail first
so now that you know some of these scams
what can you do going forward
well first of all if you do get a spam
or a scam call don't respond in any way
even by pressing a number on the keypad
I remember one time I had just booked a
hotel for example and just by chance I
got a spam call that very night claiming
to be from that company that I just
booked the hotel room with so I was kind
of thrown off guard it said something
like oh here's a free gift just press
one to learn more now normally this
would be a huge red flag but the timing
of it threw me off so just out of
curiosity I pressed one and of course it
transferred me to someone with a thick
accent saying I want a free cruise and
it was obviously a scam so I hung up but
the problem was and here's my point is
because I pressed one initially they now
knew that my number worked so they put
it on a list of working numbers or
probably sold it on a list so for
literally months afterwards I kept
getting more of the same spam calls
every week it took forever for me to
stop getting them so don't even interact
with these spammers of scammers at all
and at best don't even answer it in the
first place another thing you can do is
there are actually apps out there that
will block suspected
spam calls the one I've been using is
called mr. number I think it's the most
popular one and it also is on Android
and iPhone anyway something like that
we'll use caller ID and community
reports to automatically flag phone
numbers that are known to be scans or
heavily suspected and just block them or
at least warn you with the mr. number
app I just mentioned you can also look
at your recent call history through it
and it will show you reports other
people left about that number so it's
pretty nifty you can kind of see people
say oh this is a spam call they wanted
to offer me credit card reports or oh
that's this person calling it's just
good to know so I guess that's it those
are some common phone scams to watch out
for and some things you can do to avoid
them also hopefully you guys found this
video helpful and if you liked it be
sure to give it a thumbs up I'd really
appreciate it and let me know maybe if

many many many people so let's see I'm
excited to listen I really wanted them

you know the story I told early today is
the worst story probably they are not
interested to get money from the beggar
but less the the lady first lady was
really nice and she did that that you

Security office and all that because
she's not interested it looks like she
felt that like you to her heart like a
beggar's you know so so she drop the
call again so I'm gonna call them again
I'm calling the same number by event or
something like totally different maybe
they have just changed at our number on
the back and say like I don't know how
to do that let let's call them back one
more time
welcome to Verizon Wireless your call
cannot be completed as the cold party is
temporarily unavailable please try again
later
so it looks like they have a disable
this number and you know it's not in
access anymore so I'm calling from
Verizon number and it's in an called
part is not available so I'm gonna give
one more try and see how it goes so it
looks like they have change the number
the some I don't know what comments or
what things the first lady has put that
after I told her I'm a bagger and I have
money but she's not interested to get
money from me and she told me I go to
the Social Security office so good you

is nice you know so anyways they enjoyed
this video and stay away from these
scammers you know and I hope you will
never pay them any money into this fraud
people and you know you will be saved
from scammers so thank you very much for
watching and I will see you at the next
video
[Music]
namaste dalstro i'm here with govind and
we're outside a scam call center here in
delhi right now
and something has happened this scam
call center has
a lot of security not what we're used to
seeing and govern knows because
he is a cyber security consultant a
cyber crime consultant
and so we were just parked up just
watching what's happening first when you
get here you've got to check out their
security situation
and now these guys had people on the
street three kind of gangster looking
dudes on the street
just just patrolling just looking around
investigating any cars or anyone who
stopped nearby
and so we stopped about 20 meters up the
road and they saw the lights on in our
car because i was filming a little clip
and they started walking towards us
these three kind of kind of big dudes
and so we knew we had to get out of
there so once it got a bit closer we
left
then we turned around and we came to the
side street to watch them and they
returned back
and then a big suv pulls into the call
center
had to be the boss's suv absolutely and
these guys had to be
related to security for the boss right
that that's what i feel
because they were they were you know
just standing there and looking
looking around yeah that's it and just
investigating things
this is not normal right yeah that's
very rare because you know
in all the call centers i have seen such
security was never
never seen like anywhere not even in
mumbai it's a lot of security
and we're going to call them in a minute
and we're going to tell them that we're
here that's the point of this video
but on the security side they must be
making a ton of money to have all this
type of security here and they must be
doing
such bad stuff inside there and i know
what they're doing
they're running a tech support scam and
they have about 50 staff
in this building here in oakland so bro
let's get a bit closer
let's go outside and let's give them a
call and let's see if they'll come
outside and greet us
right are we crazy let's do it
[Music]
they're just hanging on the street there
man
we just did another round around the
call center and
there's two new security guards outside
big guys too that's how you know they're
kind of gangsters or security
and they just followed the car they were
very very interested
in who we were and why we were filming
around the call center so it tells us
one thing
whoever's running this call center
whoever's in there
it's a big guy it's a rich guy he may
have some kind of
he's got some connections if he's got so
much security with him
so yeah this is not a normal call center
this is not a normal investigation and
you know i am a little bit worried so
this place
something unique about it
if they come to our car we know that
they've called us
is it for their security
[Music]
there's general petrol general petroleum
and the only risk right now is that
these guys call their
police contacts because we just saw a
police car
in that direction we don't know if it
went there or not because we're not
gonna go and find out but
yeah that's the risk for us right now
that because we've been
hanging around there we look really
suspicious and
they could call their friends in the
police and the police can actually come
down here and
find out exactly who we are and yeah
kick us away tell us what would the
police do if it was a bad cop let's say
they would
start interrogating us if if they're bad
and if
they're the bad elements in the police
so yeah
that that is what would happen yeah we
just get they try and they try and scare
us basically
and keep us keep us away so yeah not
what we want to do tonight
but we're going to give them that call
now and let's ask them why
why you got so much security what's
going on in there
just play off them a bit and we'll tell
them we're going to report them to
police we will report these guys to the
police
not this local station though we'll go
higher
okay so they're not they're not
answering their phones and i wanted to
call them
and confront them a bit but i think it's
a good thing actually i think govind and
i have stumbled upon
a very big fish here and we should hand
this one off to the police we've done
enough of the investigation that we know
exactly
what scams they're running where they're
located we've confirmed
that there's someone big inside there
and we have a bunch of witnesses and
you know google reviews saying this is a
scam call center
i even have their the script they're
using
and i know their payment gateways we
have all the information about this
place
so we can't call them but let's send
this information directly to the police
and pray that they do something and i
will pin a comment
telling you what the police have done so

accidentally at a much higher amount

job unless you send them that money
back this scammer wants the payment in

[Music]
your customer this call is in regards
for the renewal of your computer
services
hi my name is kevin martin from firewall
computer security service
we're gonna refund the money to you okay
that's
500 how long your bank is open
um it's open till eight raj will i be
able to get the cash out and put it into
the box and send it like i did the other
time
with the aluminum foil and everything
yeah you can do that
okay i'll tell you the address tomorrow
they're trying to intercept the package
right now who is
the scammer this guy's giving us his
real name and real address
and we have this llc and everything what
they're trying to do is
have it drop somewhere else they're
trying to get it changed so it's being
held at like the ups store or something
and then
that's what they're doing now and then
they're going and picking it up
what up suckers we're doing it we're
gonna try something different
this time i think that'll be better than
trying to get him to come outside
because yeah we're gonna be like
neighbors knocking on the door and like
hey i just got my package and i saw your
package you know you just kind of okay
go grab your package
calling me or something me off the hook
like i need this information and all
this stuff
because they're 100 trying to reroute it
so i don't know if they're
spooked or whatever it was supposed to
be uh 40 000
but he changed it to the first package
supposed to be ten thousand
that was the first shipment so they're
looking for ten thousand today ten
thousand dollars
he just created an llc in april to
launder money
they call it did you put um tape on the
box anything like that stands out just
in case
it doesn't give you guys a photo holding
it down will turn it
on and off so it's off right now the
lens is right here in the center
both sides look the same but the left
side is a button so you're just gonna
if there's no lights on just hold it
down for it we'll do this we'll do it
yeah
we're gonna do it essentially blinking
means recording yeah
it's blinking it's recording now and
we'll just leave it on
you look like a cyborg
like i just pushed it once mm-hmm see
everyone inside it's not recording it's
not recording okay so it has to be just
make sure
it's blinking if for any reason they
fall off or whatever just before you put
them on make sure they're recording
and then i'll just turn them on so this
is what the building looks like
it's really nice actually yeah it's
really
do you see with scammers leaves that's
where we're going
there's a fountain out front there's
like a yeah on a corner
find a way to get him
oh there's three russian terminers
wearing 1998 oakley's that i don't know
what's going on
maybe we can go into the lobby or
something and ask about apartments
we can't get them outside and we can't
get inside without being questioned
what are we gonna do yo no matter what
we've got to get him outside yeah that's
the only way it works
there's no plan b even if you go to the
office a lot of places wouldn't give
tours on the spot you have to make an
appointment
especially right now wondering if maybe
we should make an appointment
while we're driving now for later just
in case
because then if everything else fails we
can't get in the building
say we have a a 12 30 appointment i can
just walk in and say hey my name's
ashton
uh i have an appointment yeah but dude
i have to because they're gonna take my
id that's true you know that's the other
thing even if we get in the building all
goes great he might not even answer the
floor
because they don't get packages
delivered to their doors so if there's a
delivery guy at his door
he's not gonna he may not answer it you
know if he's smart
which he's probably not says they do
self-guided tours
so
hi my name is ashton um i am looking at
places in the area
uh to relocate um i see on your website
that you offer self-guided
tours is there uh do you have to make an
appointment for that or how does that
work
as well so we can definitely show you
around okay
appointment for um uh were you looking
to stop by today tomorrow
today would be great are you flexible
with the time like could i give you like
a window like if i'm going to be there
between like
you know i don't know 11 and 1 or
something yeah
who is coming to your house i mean i'm
not really lying i really want to see
the place
you're not here to waste your time no
let him show us around or do whatever he
wants to do and then
say hey can we just have a few moments
to do self guiding so we can talk about
it
and then we can go to the door and see
what happens that could be like a worst
case scenario
i think you should do that anyways dude
i think you should totally
do the tour anyways art can just be like
hey dude
uh is your name i think they've
delivered your box to my
thing or something yeah you know what
i'm saying and you're just a neighbor
you wouldn't even need it you're just
his neighbor bro you wouldn't even need
a box you can just walk up to the door
and say hey i grabbed my packages
there's one with your name on it
is this for you and just kind of like
refer to down the hallway even though
it's not really there
oh but we're just as bad as the scammers
because we lied about a phone charger a
chapstick
right yeah i know we have a break uh if
we go
in together as uh potential customers i
don't think we should both be wearing
classes yeah because we look like two
terminators they're like ready to
conquer that freaking dog so maybe you
wear the glasses and i will just use my
phone because if i'm actually there
looking for an apartment i would be
taking pictures
good
[Music]
um
[Music]
[Music]
he's on the no parking spot when there
is a spot right next to him
maybe right there oh you can't get in i
didn't see there was a gate my fault
well then what is the ultimate goal then
just answer the door do you see his face
that's it well what else are we going to
what do you want to do we want to mud
wrestle him like
oh here maybe over here oh wait don't i
think this is the same
guest oh my god it's a pet spa
yes parking lot yeah all right we'll
just hang out then i guess until someone
knows
when we get to the door me and brandon
will go out of view a little bit just
down
like you know 15 feet away from the door
so if he looks at the peephole he just
sees you knock on the door hopefully
he'll open it
but he might say who is it either way
you're gonna say hey i live down the
hall and i have a package for you
right uh it was put in my box or
something then we're just gonna talk to
him as long as we can until he shuts the
door in our face
give something that like look i have
your box it's got drop off by at my unit
by accident come get it
walk with him and give him package and
confront him
[Music]
i don't know
i have zero service really no service
so our list is almost over we have to
give them notice in um
yeah that's fine appreciate it

the inside
uh and get in from the garage doors and
the cabinet box closer everything is
absolutely so so i have no interest
all right
[Music]
foreign
so
so this level here
so this area here
and then i got one more level to show
you up here wow
deliberate and stuff um
um there was like a little seating area
on the second floor yeah
um is there a way we can just sit there
and talk for a little bit like yeah
i really liked that view i just wanted
to
[Music]
thank you so much we'll see you in the
office uh as you know you need to
you'll need me to get back down to the
elevator so how long how long do you
need
um i don't know just uh two minutes yeah
so we we're limited with where we can
like just explode
yeah do you want to do yeah that's fine
if we're if we're done early can we just
come to the office and meet you uh
you'll need me to get that down to the
elevator
but i'll be able to see you from the
leasing office okay so i'll be on the
lookout so just wait
gotcha okay now come out and say i'll
come up again okay perfect
you so much
um we saw the guy yeah
we saw the guy in pink t-shirts yeah
there's a stairwell i saw a stairwell
over there
but it's probably the same yeah
okay
we missed that opportunity i didn't yet
know
that we would be uh restricted
on going back there i thought this was
the perfect plan
see anything we do in front of him
like
[Music]
all right
talk to the guy to this guy and say look
look she says who we are
we're looking for his camera and camera
live in this place can you
you know explain him what's up i know
it's tricky but he's not gonna
take us to the door there's no way
that's why it's plenty
yeah perfect thank you
awesome thank you thank you so much for
your time really appreciate it
fudge
actually i saw in the garage i don't
know about here
okay you see there is another way to get
in but
boom that's um that's stairs
those are stairs yeah those are stairs
but again i can
we can get on the second floor and it's
one more thing
to accomplish and is that um
that that key fob yeah once you start
asking questions he's already busted
right boom
stairs yeah and he's walking up to the
stairs
but you need a fab to get in the stairs
too huh yeah well
no not here not here oh maybe you need
one to get
in but when you approach second floor
you need i i i truly yeah that's gonna
be the same situation
so i'll see you i have no service what a
[ __ ]
i got nothing yeah dude as soon as i
texted you
we walked by and the guy's door open and
i was like no
i worried one of you be like that was
him like what
that's why i kind of like stopped and
turned around and i was i was so close
because i was about to be like oh my
back hurts
let me stop for a second and like kind
of delay it but it just didn't it didn't
feel right or whatever it didn't feel
right it didn't feel like it was a 100
percent the right decision right here
and i didn't want to [ __ ] it up right
there that's good then no i didn't do it
it's okay but
yeah i'm gonna check the stairs
[Music]
yeah that's what i thought you need a
key fob
to get on the second floor you need keep
up to get into the building
so two clicks i can go outside and um
i can walk outside and get this service
okay
we'll i'll keep an eye here and for
anyone okay are you texting anything to
you
should i text him something i was just
asking if he got the number yet
tell him why
never gonna win
so
okay two things that doesn't make sense
i can swear right now
that ups just put this box with this big
red
um orange thing over there yeah in um
in a locker in a locker but uh scammer
payback texted us and he said they just
texted me and said no cash in the box
which doesn't make sense because i saw
ex like are you sure i was
looking at ups guy and he had this size
box
with um orange on the side so either the
bluffing
that might be a traditional ups label
though
so could have been another one
but i need to go girls because like i
would not know what he's saying because
all right
just go go do what you gotta do i'm
gonna call him and tell him what's up
hey brother okay listen the situation is
very
uh tricky over here the building is so
protected we did a tour
maybe he's blocking because i swear
i swear that i saw um
i saw you ups guy uh putting right now
with the red with the orange tape
putting back the uh package right now in
a box
maybe they're bluffing okay we will
figure out okay but that's what are
happening right now
okay um i swear ups guy put
bugs that belongs to us um he just
brought more boxes
and on the rest of the boxes there is no
orange stage
it was orange tape it was exactly like
this and i was looking on a pierogi
picture and he was holding like this
and i got closer and i see orange tape
across exactly the same
and he opened and put in the locker and
i received text message from pierogi uh
texas pierogi and said why would you do
this there is no cash why are you lying
and i said pierogi play alone maybe he's
bluffing because i saw the box i was
like i might be wrong
and i explained him situation that uh
everything is protected with a key fob
and we're trying to weasel ourselves to
the second floor to at least talk to the
guy
even if he got the package [ __ ] it
doesn't matter package is irrelevant
right now right
but there is a huge possibility what i
feel that that
can right now show up i'm out come out
here come on
picture dude walk out any moment now
yeah yeah but he specifically had a pink
shirt on
yeah no i saw it yeah half hour ago and
i saw this locker room
um the bugs got dropped also and
nobody's picked it up since
no no because i was like they're closing
it from you i can see it from here all
right
so we have two options right now either
you know again maybe they're bluffing
and they're just trying to see if he's
for real or not
is that him behind me that's him that's
him
i told you yeah that's him let's do it
let's go let's do it

monday our day of our day our world be

hey guys I made already some video about
America geeks and I totally forgot to
explain who these scammers are that I
infiltrate them since December 2017 and
what they do this will be a long and
detailed video but it's definitely worth
to watch since a league like this has
not happened before yet so this is a one
of a kind video on YouTube I can
guarantee you this also if you want to
see the video without blurred faces
click on the DTO link in the description
I uploaded it there so here we go it all
started when I found one of these fake
pop-ups that America geeks were sending
it says something about some dangerous
try to get my person looking and bank
information and furthermore tells me my
computer is infected with a Trojan virus
and that I need to instantly call on
that toll-free number which is provided
there they had multiple similar popups
like this which I learned later so I
thought I give it a try and scan made
them a bit and called them they told me
they are America geeks and that they
were Microsoft certified technicians and
all that [ __ ] and then they
proceeded to direct me to their website
[Music]
www.rinaldin.com aid some bogus services
on my computer like showing me stopped
services in the temp folder and saying
that they are hidden viruses which is
obviously a lie can you repeat again
what is with these files yeah well these
try a lot of reason that our computers
are at risk
ok these files come from different
websites or when we will emails when we
are connected to internet they just come
in our system and due to which our
system gets in trouble ok as far as I am
checking here there are a lot of files
here also I think the viruses yeah
they are these are the Microsoft
services which makes your securities
working which makes your computer work
and you can see they're all stopped they
don't know Microsoft Security earnings
right we need to renew them as well sir
so sir forty to do that sir I have to
generate a licensure that comes for like
three years five years in the lifetime
you are talking to America geek three
other technical support provider then
they told me the fixation of all those
problems will be solved if I take one of
their plans with the most expensive one
lifetime subscription costing six 99.99
US dollars to make the payment complete
they guided me to
www.americanoutback.net about them
firstly I used by a shark while they
were connected to my computer to correct
their IP address looking at that IP
address revealed one of their company
names mark software systems and through
the website of India Ministry of
Corporate Affairs I could see that the
owner is Kunal and Mohit pencil and
someone called a month Preet Singh
brought but none of my sources has ever
seen that person so we assumed this
person was part of it in 2013 when the
company got incorporated and it's no
longer relevant and it also showed me
one of their locations although I
quickly found out the real call center
location after some time I found out
that the real company name is Leakes
technical solutions the address they
provided on several of their website is
a dead end though I called that call
center over and over again and
eventually I made contacts with
employees and ex employees who were
providing me a lot of insider
information
moreover fellow scam writers that I
worked with managed to hack their
servers getting access to the email
server and web site with the help of
that that data leak
could verify and add missing information
and map out the whole company also we
discovered shocking information for
example that geeks employees saved
customer account details and logins as
plain text maybe for malicious purposes
we learned that Kunal and Mohit pencil
two Punjabi brothers are the owners and
our officially listed as directors of
this company in their cousin man Mohan
pencil is director of Sky browser
another company related to them then
there is Chaman Deep Singh senior
manager of blue alpha IT their student
loan scam company I will cover both
those companies in a different video
though other important people are Kapil
Sharma assistant manager Kanaka Jain and
vibe of Jane she was head of web
development and thus responsible for the
fake pop-up that they were sending on
the internet Varun wata won one of the
team leaders in sales and number one
performing in sales Gaurav Sharma
exemplary of compact and Google and now
marketing head of the company and
vicar's party expansion manager and boss
of the fairly new open course and a
branch in Tunisia called geeks Franz
another important persons later on will
be Naresh Kumar subject matter expert in
research and development and [ __ ]
Shama tevia of special care also known
as customer care by searching America
geeks aka geeks technical solutions on
the Internet it was possible to find out
a lot of their numbers especially on
scammer got info a website dedicated to
expose scammer numbers so that scam
betas can call them and waste the
scammers time to protect people from
getting scammed it was possible to find
them because members of that community
got the pop-up and posted the number
there and also called number to get to
know which companies behind it this info
den was posted in the threats so it was
working like text
and I could easily search for their new
numbers also through the data leak or
heck we got access to one of their excel
files which listed all of their numbers
by running these numbers through Google
search I could uncover a lot of their
fake sites that are placed for Co
purposes to attract new customers
examples are I take Viacom America geek
payment comm geek America's comm office
activation dotnet or printer - tech -
support - help calm also related to
these numbers and websites out a bunch
of social media accounts like Facebook
YouTube and Twitter they use social
media to spread the numbers even more
and to attract new scam victims a lot of
them have been deleted by now one
Facebook page in particular was
interesting because it seemed to be
their main page and it contained lots of
pictures of the authors in the employees
at certain special events such as
birthdays celebrations or national
holidays like Christmas
Holi Republic Lee and Diwali through
this Facebook page and through those
pics together with employees information
I could map out the office building in
the basement there's the HR department
as well as training rooms where any
newly joined employees katraine for the
scan and also got some lessons in how to
speak properly English and how to
imitate accents in the first floor there
was the call center floor with the
little cubicles for each sales agent and
a lot of security cams on the ceiling
apparently they had trust issues with
the employees one floor above and second
floor there was sky browser in the
travel agency the floor also has this
cubicle set up on the third floor
there's blue alpha IT their student loan
scam in the cafeteria and another
training room are also there
the call center employed
100 to 500 people in the different
shifts to be available 24/7 to make the
most profit possible out of the skin
actually the salary sheet of April 2018
shows 596 employees but also containing
a dozen of employees who resigned or who
are fired in total they spent about 14
million Indian rupees on salaries in
April which converts to 205 thousand US
dollars or 175 euros the employees also
got incentives based on the sales they
made which works like this each employee
has to achieve a target sales and after
completion every additional sales gets
you a percentage of that sale starting
with 5% each year you stay with the
company your percentage will increase by
1% these incentives were paid out
differently
a typical scammer or tech sales executed
"as I call it earns about 22,000 Indian"
rupees fixed salary which is about 320
u.s. dollars or 270 euros then the
incentives afresh I can make is around
"15,000 rupees which is 220 years US"
dollars where's a normal and experienced
sales agent can make around 20 to 30 K
rupees which is about 290 to 440 US
dollars and if an agent gets promoted as
team leader he is allowed to call
existing customers again to pitch them
to pay for another fake service we
actually have a real caller recording
with the victim that got pitched again
hi Frank this is JV here I'm the
security supervisor how eating today
I'm doing good all right Frank's I'm
working on the computer are you near to
the computer right now yes all right so
I'm running a scan here to take in a
little while so you need to be with me
on the line all right I'm gonna put you
on hold right I'll get back to you thank
you all right Ron thank you for staying
online you there yeah all right the
Microsoft services are getting stopped
you see here everything is stopped
yeah along with the third we found a
file on the computer
which is a kind of ransomware tax which
is going on from last a couple of months
and it has already infected more than
five million computers in 150 countries
so if you look over here do you see what
this file says it's a kind of bad rabbit
ransomware you see this yeah all right
we have to block it down and that can
only be done by installing the complete
secure socket layer fee all right which
you don't have
and they always wait wait wait a goddamn
minute sir I just upgraded my drivers
day sorry what do you think I talked to
your supervisor the last time $399 or in
order to be installed yes you have a
Norton on the computer Frank that's what
that's fine no problem Frank if you
think so that we always charge you the
thing is that this is a completely
different license which you don't have
with us so that's why we had
recommending you as being a technician
that tells possibilities no problem
that's why those team leaders could
easily get over 1 lakh Indian rupees
"which is $1,500"
extra on their salary a normal employee
makes in total about six hundred ten to
seven hundred sixteen US dollars per
month including both fixed salary and
incentives and a team leader over two
thousand one hundred US dollars as their
fixed salary is already higher I also
heard that varun dhawan the number one
seller he got about four thousand US
dollars per month and considered the low
living cost in India this is actually a
lot what is interesting is that the
other departments such as customer care
escalations or HR just got a fixed
salary without those incentives and the
fixed salary isn't even adjusted so
these jobs were not really well paid
another interesting fact is that they
even employed twenty eight office boys I
guess to make them coffee or other basic
jobs I actually interviewed one of their
sales a sales agents about the salary
and about the working condition that
geeks this will come out as a separate
video as well so how much money did they
cost to make they are selling service
plans on different
the most expensive one is a lifetime
plan for six 99.99 u.s. dollars or
sometimes 700 99.99 according to the
confirmation emails lesson to the
customers
on some days they were sending porn
pop-ups so that the victims were even
more intimidated and were more willing
to pay as this conversation shows so in
one single day they made around fifty
thousand US dollars on average still
they didn't even pay Google for the
AdWords campaign apparently if they made
fifty thousand US dollar each day and at
30 days per month since they were
working 24/7
that's a turnover of about 1.5 million
US dollars per month I already mentioned
before that their salary expenses of two
hundred five thousand US dollars and
also they had to pay for the phone call
$900 450 thousand minutes they did have
some other expenses such as sometimes
they paid for security software but
sometimes they even use pirated copies
of official software such as Microsoft
Office but even then deducting those
expenses that's still around 1.3 million
u.s. dollars so what about the persons I
was talking about earlier who now Bansal
the call center boss he's in the end of
his twenties according to sources he's
27 he studied at University Institute of
legal studies in Chandigarh together
with his brother Mohit they started the
business
even before gigs Pina jewelry that buys
and sells gold rings another jewelry as
the name already suggests then he
started tech support process together
with his brother and cousin he had a
Facebook profile where he even publicly
showed that he is the director of mark
software systems a company registered by
him and Mohit he shut down his Facebook
profile though he is known for having
bodyguards at his side which he
originally had employed for the jewelry
business but he uses them now as a
status symbol
latest info about him is that he got
engaged on June 3rd and is now married
and it's an arranged marriage he's
listed as director for both Sky browser
and
his salary is about 85 K Indian rupees
"which is 1,200 u.s. dollars for Sky"
browser and the same amount for geeks
which would be two thousand four hundred
US dollars in total
his main earnings are the profits of the
companies of both companies at the end
of the fiscal year and the salary is
just a salary to be able to pay bills
and other expenses during the year Mohit
Bansal he's a ghost he does not have any
social media accounts at least which are
known and even on that geeks Facebook
profile with over 500 pics there was not
a single picture of Moorhead there's not
much known about him it's just known
that he also got married recently
end of April he married an Indian
businesswoman according to my sources
she also works in a call center same as
"his brother he's earning about 2,400"
u.s. dollars but the same story goes yes
well main earnings at the end of the
fiscal year
man Nolan Bansal is the cousin of both
Kunal and Mahesh
he is using social media and his pics
were openly visible on that geeks
Facebook account he's listed as director
for Sky browser on a salary sheet and
"then runs about 50,000 Indian rupees"
which is about 700 dollars since he's a
director his main profits will also come
at the end of the fiscal year with the
company profits then there's the
question about the money meal the person
which sits in the United States and
collects the money and routes it back to
India also that person needs to register
a company in the US this person is
incredibly valuable for them because
this person allows him to operate so if
we could get this person we could get
him arrested and guess what we found
that person through the hacks we had
access to the email accounts and one
email address in particular was
surprising Julien brand at USA
Technology llc.com
also Julien brand's American Express
credit card was there in the email
account as a scan at a bunch of things
were paid on his credit cards with Kunal
Bansal s name this made me suspicious so
I googled unite us a technology LLC and
on Better Business Bureaus website USA
Technology LLC showed up and had my
pants on as CEO God
then I looked up that LLC and found
official dogs stating you Julian brand
is registra of that company also shown
there are two different addresses
I googled them to find out that they are
also related to geeks into Sky browser
then I proceeded to search for him on
Facebook and I found this guy according
to his Facebook profile he's in a
relationship with a girl called Hannah
so I checked her profile as well and
voila they have been together in Nepal
and guess where else in Chandigarh I
asked a couple of employees and even
they confirmed that it's him so it's
definitely him we have found the money
mule funny side fact he's an actor
that's a video on Vimeo showing us
acting real I don't know I worked
together with malwarebytes renowned
antivirus and internet security company
as they also published a bunch of
articles about geeks apparently geeks
were also impersonating their support
hotline and since then my robots were
after them and published articles about
them as well I will post links in the
description so I shared everything with
them as well to further push the story
and to further escalate the story with
us American authorities so those
authorities are investigating the scam
as well also malwarebytes had some info
that I didn't have about geeks runs
geeks runs is a branch of French calls
me cos mati expansion manager took care
of that and opened a call center in
Tunisia malwarebytes found out some info
about them and according to my sources
it didn't run so well they had problems
with employees and it closed soon after
they started it meanwhile fellows gambit
has recalled flooding geeks
my previous video shows those cards they
had a massive core value of just our
calls
some guy perfected the technique and he
alone could output 212 at the same time
to the call center ending up blocking
them from taking customer calls and
costing the scammers a lot of time and
money they were literally begging me to
stop these call floods have
over several weeks then all of a sudden
everything was over from one day to
another geeks fired 200 to 300 employees
and shut down the whole tech process I
couldn't reach him anymore on any of
their phone numbers and on my youtube
channel angry comments of Indian persons
appeared and on other social media where
I have fake accounts they started to
blame me for everything
I couldn't believe what's going on there
so I confront with other sources and
their parents it was true the real
reasons are still unknown rumors say
that they heard about an incoming income
tax right by the police and that's why
they shut down others said they were
planned planning to shut down the
process since a long time ago already
another theory might be that due to our
spam calls which should have cost them
quite some fortune the scam wasn't
profitable and not any their websites
went down Kunal and Moritz private
Facebook accounts were suddenly
unavailable the whole operation vanished
as if it has never existed so isn't this
the end stay tuned for the next video
[Music]
[Music]

scammer payback as you can see with
these green twirly things we're still

talking with the Telstra support
scammers and telling them very specific
things about where they live and where
they work
get them spooked as much as possible

scammers these days are getting trickier
and trickier and now there is a brand
new phone scam out there that everyone
should know about it's not that common
apparently but it's still pretty
interesting and I thought I'd talk about
it so in this video we're gonna go over
five common telephone scams to watch out
for
including this brand new one so first
what is this new scam you may have
already seen it mentioned in the news
it's often referred to as the can you
hear me scam and what happens is the
scammer will call your phone number and
ask a simple question it may be can you
hear me or is this the head of household
or something like that and they know
that you will answer yes to whatever
question they asked or at least they're
hoping to and simply by saying the word
yes or I agree or something like that
now they've got you wait a minute what
do you mean they got me I just said yes
that's right because this is what
happened
you see when that scammer called you
they are recording that call and they
just want you to say yes or some other
positive response so they have that
recording of you that they can use later
then they're gonna hit you with some
sort of bogus charge to your phone bill
or utility bill or something like that
for example it is possible for some
services to apply charges right through
your phone bills such as those hotlines
that you know what I'm talking about and
the reason they get the recording of you
is that they will actually edit an audio
clip of them saying something like do
you agree to this charge or whatever and
then tack on your yes response that they
had so now they have a supposed proof
recording of you agreeing to charges
that you never agreed to such as if the
phone company asks for proof that you
actually did agree to this charge or you
go to challenge it later it's a very
tricky stuff
so here's the best thing to do to avoid
this type of scam if you get a call that
asks can you hear me then obviously just
hang up immediately that's the scam but
if you aren't sure like if they say is
this whoever maybe respond by saying may
I ask who's calling and why don't say
yes or anything like that then you can
probably judge the response yourself if
they're legitimate of course most of the
time you can just tell if it's a
telemarketer or some
thing so I'd say just hang up either way
no need to even waste your time you
don't have to be nice to the
telemarketers and I'm sure you know if
you tell telemarketers in general that
you're not interested they won't leave
it at that they're gonna try to keep
bugging you to keep you talking even
though you're not interested at all so
better to just not take the risk okay so
that might be the newest scam but what
are some other ones to watch out for the
next one is the so called star 72 scam
or a call forwarding scam and this one
is another tricky one that might not
seem obvious if you don't know what's
going on for those not aware star 72 is
one of the many star codes you can type
in your phone either it's a cell phone
or a landline that will perform
different functions star 72 in
particular activates call forwarding so
when you type in star 72 then any phone
number it will then forward all calls to
your number to the other phone number
that you just typed in so in this scam
the scammer will try to get you to type
in a phone number beginning with star 72
for example they may say we were in an
accident and we need you to call an
ambulance or hospital and then give you
the code and then the phone number and
they might say oh well this star code
allows you to get directly to the doctor
or something like that meanwhile now all
your calls are gonna get forwarded to
that number there's also another one
where they say oh they're calling from
jail and they called the wrong number
and they only get one phone call can you
please call my wife or something like
that
and then they get you to type it in that
way but either way if someone asks you
to type in a star code it's a scam and
then after you do that the scammer will
give your phone number to someone who
wants to call them from like long
distance collect so you have to pay for
all those collect calls and the two
scammers can talk as much as they want
while you foot the bill because the
collect call is technically being
forwarded through you so they just use
your phone number to steal calls and
they don't have to pay for it no matter
how long distance it is so just be aware
of what star codes are and don't type
any of them in if someone tells
you to the next scam is one that is
definitely not new but people somehow
still fall for it sometimes it's the
notorious Windows support scam this is
where you'll get a random phone call
from someone who claims to be from
Microsoft or sometimes from Windows yeah
it doesn't even make sense but they'll
say something along the lines of your
computer has been sending us error
messages let me help you fix it and then
they guide you through some ridiculous
process on your computer that will show
supposed errors as proof that your
computer clearly is broken but here's
the scam part then they tell you that to
fix it you need to download a certain
program from whatever website they give
and of course it's a virus and then
after that they have full control of
your computer they're gonna log
everything you type into it and of
course use it to steal your money
so yeah Microsoft is not gonna call you
about your computer next up is a more
general type of scam which are fake bank
security calls and I thought I'd talk
about this because they are kind of
tricky because sometimes the bank or
credit card company will call you if
they suspect fraud is occurring so I
thought I'd go over how to be sure that
you're not gonna fall for this so for
example a scammer may call you and claim
to be the bank and say that your card
has a suspicious charge or something
like that
they may also leave a message saying
call back this number for the fraud
department and then before they can tell
you about it they need to verify the
credit card number which of course
involves you giving them their credit
card number so what should you do about
this what if the credit card company is
actually calling you about fraud well
what I say is anytime you get a call or
message claiming to be from the bank
always make sure you call them so go to
your bank's website and call the
official number there or the one on the
back of the card and have them just
transfer you to the correct department
you can't be sure that the person who
calls you is who they say they are or
for example if they're fake and they say
oh call our fraud Department and of
course it's not really that so you want
to make sure that you're calling
something that you know is lead
now finally I just have to quickly
mention the notorious IRS scam calls
these are pretty easy to spot and almost
always involve someone calling you from
the IRS or some other tax agency saying
that you own a bunch of taxes and if you
don't pay up you're gonna go to jail now
the important thing to know here and the
main point is that with this the IRS
does not call people without sending a
letter first
so if out of the blue you just get a
message saying oh you're gonna go to
jail if you don't pay us yeah that's
obviously a scam for something that's
serious the IRS would definitely send
you a notice via certified mail so you
wouldn't just get it lost in the mail so
there's not much more to say about that
one they're pretty obvious but just know
that the IRS in general doesn't call you
without letting you know by mail first
so now that you know some of these scams
what can you do going forward
well first of all if you do get a spam
or a scam call don't respond in any way
even by pressing a number on the keypad
I remember one time I had just booked a
hotel for example and just by chance I
got a spam call that very night claiming
to be from that company that I just
booked the hotel room with so I was kind
of thrown off guard it said something
like oh here's a free gift just press
one to learn more now normally this
would be a huge red flag but the timing
of it threw me off so just out of
curiosity I pressed one and of course it
transferred me to someone with a thick
accent saying I want a free cruise and
it was obviously a scam so I hung up but
the problem was and here's my point is
because I pressed one initially they now
knew that my number worked so they put
it on a list of working numbers or
probably sold it on a list so for
literally months afterwards I kept
getting more of the same spam calls
every week it took forever for me to
stop getting them so don't even interact
with these spammers of scammers at all
and at best don't even answer it in the
first place another thing you can do is
there are actually apps out there that
will block suspected
spam calls the one I've been using is
called mr. number I think it's the most
popular one and it also is on Android
and iPhone anyway something like that
we'll use caller ID and community
reports to automatically flag phone
numbers that are known to be scans or
heavily suspected and just block them or
at least warn you with the mr. number
app I just mentioned you can also look
at your recent call history through it
and it will show you reports other
people left about that number so it's
pretty nifty you can kind of see people
say oh this is a spam call they wanted
to offer me credit card reports or oh
that's this person calling it's just
good to know so I guess that's it those
are some common phone scams to watch out
for and some things you can do to avoid
them also hopefully you guys found this
video helpful and if you liked it be
sure to give it a thumbs up I'd really
appreciate it and let me know maybe if

99 dollars okay so you need to fill up a
phone for that mm-hmm so you have any
kind of laptop I'll be at your place
yeah course okay so what do you like to
open that I'm already sitting in my desk
so yeah okay so open up your browser any
browser like Google Chrome or Safari I'm
there I just type in WWE trying yeah
typing it in Amazon Prime a85 Oh God
wet WEP and Oh de doctor calm okay
and then
it says a site that it says the site
cannot be reached
ww Amazon Prime 8500 de comm is it n
like Nancy or M like Mary oh there's no
there's no dot between web and node hey
there's no dot between vet and now G
okay let's see okay Amazon Prime video
yeah okay I see the button that you guys
have at the bottom it says cancel and
refund service okay our services and I'm
here I'm listening okay so download
TeamViewer hold on I'm not that smart
with this stuff
it says TeamViewer setup.exe at the
bottom yeah so click on that one it's
done no it says please closed team I
think I already had TeamViewer in this
computer before it says please close
TeamViewer before installing if
TeamViewer starts automatically with
Windows right-click on whatever boo I
think TeamViewer is already on the
system from a previous time so let me
see yeah I have the TeamViewer app on
the computer okay I mean I'm in it I
opened it it says allow remote control
ID and password okay what do we I can't
go in there and cancel it myself
or you have to go inside and do it
yes sir we need to fill out the form you
have to fill up the form okay and i-751
zero zero zero one zero four seven 4w
and oh you know what hold on one second
something just popped up one moment so
how much money do you make from this
from India I'm just curious
sorry how much money do you make from
this money what I'm also Indian I'm not
really I'm kind of into the IT space
myself like I'm not I'm not stupid like
what do you feel good about trying to
rip people off I'm not getting it what
you're trying to say oh you'll be famous
here in a second I got this on I've been
videotaping on speakerphone the entire
time so we know the call center that
you're at in India it'll be on YouTube
here shortly how do you feel about that
I mean do you make a good amount of
money from that you feel proud of what
you do that's what I thought okay so the
lines been disconnected for those that
don't know exactly what just happened
I was sitting here at my desk I got an
inbound phone call from that five one
six number he said that he was calling
from Amazon and that my monthly bill had
gone to thirty four ninety nine
obviously nobody's gonna pay thirty four
ninety nine for Amazon Prime so then
naturally you want to cancel so instead
of just taking the information over the
phone and canceling and he tells you to
go to this website and it's not a real
website it's never gonna be Amazon is
like the richest company in the world
they can afford to have Amazon Prime
calm or whatever it is they're not gonna
have Amazon Prime 8:50 webnode calm or
whatever so this is a website that they
basically made themselves trying to look
like Amazon Prime and did a really
crappy job of it this is not a good
website so these guys are clearly
amateurs and then they have the cancel
and refund service here but he had you
go to like our services and then they
want you to download Team Viewer for
Windows or TeamViewer for Mac and
obviously you're gonna think it's
suspicious by going to TeamViewer
website directly so what they do is they
put it on the website so it seems like
it's trusted by you because it's coming
from this Amazon website which is a fake
website to begin with so please do not
fall for this this is BS so I have
Windows so I click TeamViewer but I
already have it on there he must have
been thinking in the back of his mind
that somebody else had already ripped me
off previously because I actually have
TeamViewer don't try to type in the ID
and password because you're not gonna
get through I'm pretty savvy with this
stuff so I'm not gonna post this on
YouTube and then leave it the same for
you to go ahead and try to login to my
computer but yeah have fun with it if
you want to try it's up to you but
that's all I just happen to have my
phone ready when he called in and I
thought it would be useful I can share
and hopefully I don't want to see any of
my friends family or any of my audience
fall victim to something like this
because once they gain access to your
computer there's no telling what they
can do just don't do it nobody you
should never download anything onto your
computer simply from a random phone call
that you get because these are scammers
and they're calling from call centers in
India which is a shame because I'm
Indian I'm not proud that they're coming
from my country but it is what it is
just don't fall victim to it the smarter
we get about this they'll go away the
reason why these scams have been going
on for 10 years or more is because
people are falling for them so stop
falling for them like I've seen all the
scams from the Nigerian scam to this and
every time I get one I'm gonna videotape
it and I'm gonna post it and try to help
you guys not fall for it please share
feel free to like subscribe and be safe

VARIATION KNOWN AS NEIGHBOR
SPOOFING WHERE CALLERS MIMIC
if your social security number gets
compromised
your identity can literally be stolen
social security number scams are more
popular than
ever so listen carefully to the ones
that are trending
this week my name is dom i'll be your
host while you're watching
scam detector
the number one scam on this list is
literally happening
this week so make sure to watch till the
end to find out what it is
now before we dive into the scams let me
briefly explain
why social security number aka ssn
scams can work so those nine digits can
work as
authenticators which means that
authorities assume that only you would
know them so essentially if a criminal
gets their hands on your social security
number
they can basically steal your identity
if people
hear that something is wrong with their
social security number
they get scared and will want to fix it
immediately
and if people are more spooked than
aware they might as well become a victim
of one of the scams
i'm about to talk about number four
suspended security benefits or number
this is one of the good old telephone
scams you get a call from a random
number and i say random
because the actual number can be
different each time when you pick up the
phone an automated voice message will
say
something like
the this we called today is to tell you
that your social security benefits were
suspended
due to suspicious activity if you want
to find out more about this case
press number one
i mean that sounds pretty serious right
so of course you press number one
then a real person will pick it up and
ask for all kind of personal information
you know banking details phone number
facebook password maybe your
fingerprints even and
not measure social security number and
the more info you give in
the deeper it will get that you're in at
this point
now if you want to avoid the scam the
one thing you have to note is that the
ssa
social security administration doesn't
suspend your card at this time
and you also have to be really
precautious with the information you
share
over the phone i mean not sharing your
personal information
over the phone is how not to get scammed
101
number three social security stimulus
so when people are short of money due to
losing their jobs
because of a well i don't know pandemic
for example doesn't really happen too
often
but anyway people will receive their
stimulus checks and probably seek out
every financial aid
there is in this example scammers target
people who are receiving social security
disability checks
victims of this scam stated that they
met people who told them that they were
eligible for federal stimulus or
educational grants
even if they didn't attend school of
course in order to get them money
they will have to provide their personal
information social security number and
banking details then an income tax
return would be filed on their behalf
and then a refund would be deposited on
their accounts
this is really freaking complicated who
wrote the script now
this could be a really serious situation
because the false return could create a
number of
problems and it can even lead to the
victim losing their social security
disability income
now if you don't want to be a victim of
this scam just be really precautious
with what you share over the phone
mainly if it's about your personal
information and one other thing to note
is that
you can get a federal grant that you
didn't apply to
number two fake social security
administration employee
now i think it's something that everyone
is supposed to know
but the more you share about yourself
online the more risk you put yourself at
and the next scam perfectly proves that
you get a call from a
fake social security administration
employee informing you that you are
being investigated for fraud
like wait what i'm a criminal now and
these dudes are straight-a students and
they did their homework on you by
checking your social media
where you literally post about
everything
and now in the possession of all that
information about you
they can seem legit in the conversation
now if you've been a good guy all your
life
this could really look out of order
because you don't just become a criminal
all of a sudden but these scammers
also know that so they use official
verbiage in fact
so you would believe them and once they
feel like they hook you in enough they
start asking for the usual information
about yourself you know
social security number facebook password
i already said that joke
and if you're actually negligent enough
and you share those
information about yourself it can lead
to identity theft or
credit card charges and neither one of
them is really good
like i like being dumb and i like my
money on my credit card so
the best way to avoid this scam is to be
careful with what you say over the phone
and also if you really want to post
about everything on social media
just use the proper privacy settings for
god's sake
and now let me present you the hottest
social security numbers camp
that is happening this week like like
this cam is so hot that if it was
this iphone case it would be
so freaking hot number one social
security administration visit
now this last scam is slightly similar
to the previous one
you receive a call from somebody who is
claiming to be working for the social
security administration aka
ssa he tells you that the ssa will have
a home visit over at your place and
you're like okay
but they obviously need some information
about you before the scheduled
appointment
nothing nothing extraordinary though you
know just your social security number
other personal information banking
details credit card number
maybe but definitely not your address
now fortunately many people don't fall
for this scam because it seems a bit
suspicious
right at the beginning you know many
people just laughed it off and tell them
to swing by
they don't know the address anyway
because they didn't ask for it
but these scammers call hundreds of
people each day
and by the law of big numbers some less
careful individuals
will fall for the scam and if they share
their social security number and other
personal information
the next thing they'll know that they
are victims of identity theft
now i'm not even going to tell you how
to avoid this scam because it's so
freaking obvious
just don't freaking share your personal
information over the phone
that's it it's that simple but that is
the video for today i hope you enjoyed
and i hope
i could share some useful information
with you and
if that's the case please give this
video a big thumbs up and subscribe to
the channel
for more videos like this my name is dom
i'm going to see you next time and you

criminals took hundreds of millions of
dollars from this scam alone the victims
included people all over the United
States as I said they targeted primarily
immigrants and the elderly the
defendants called the same California
man more than 20 times over a 20-day
period
demanding payment for alleged tax
violations they succeeded in extorting
that victim of one hundred and thirty
six thousand dollars federal and state
law enforcement officials today have
arrested 20 individuals two other
individuals are also in custody and
they've executed nine search warrants
across eight states in a coordinated
takedown of this organization we really
want to get the word out to the public
that if you get one of these calls it is
not the US government calling you even
if your caller ID says as is did in many
of these instances US government IRS or
some other government agency it is not
the US government it is a scam the US
government does not operate in this
manner we never call to demand that
money be loaded immediately onto prepaid
cards the US government agencies do not
call and demand immediate payments to
avoid deportation
or to avoid arrest
so I keep getting these prank calls from
Apple saying I have iCloud and I get a
call from Dominican Republic earlier -

hi everyone and welcome to the part 2 of
the web Dax solutions Private Limited
scammer company in this video which from
one PC could smash to spread the access
to seven more of their machines that
they used to scan all of the time the
majority of the machines did just sit
idle but sometimes I did receive
incoming calls we saw quite a lot of
horrible things while watching this
company and also a lot of funny things
as well
ie watching scam bakers flood their
lines and then finally towards the end
of the video when the scammer started
catching on that there were being what
and in response started to system
restore all of their computers we then
infected all the computers with the
memes Trojan this piece of malware
overwrites the bootloader so as soon as
the computer boots up all they see is
the nyan cat so we'll start off by
showing one of the pretty nasty things
that we observed ma'am your network
prediction service that is a Windows
Defender it's an pre-installed service

this this computer will run for more
twenty years Wow yeah that will be fine
ma'am you give us a call back okay on a
lighter note of the whole song that we
had access to all these scammers
computers we didn't actually see him get
a successful scam want the majority at
the time was spent answering the course
of scam biters and victims
luckily catching on so there wasn't much
work I could do to prevent the scams
because luckily all the victims knew
about the particular scams running
whilst we were observing in the previous
video I did discuss how they run
IRS and
tessai scams as well as refunds gums and
the classic technical support scam but
the whole time we were watching them
there chose at the refund scam as their
scam of choice after some time of
watching them just get on the phone by
their potential victims their number was
posted on Bob RTC by another scam beta
this led to a flood of cool and a lot of
their time wasted being scammed baited
I'll show some those clips now thanks

years wow this is the [ __ ] point in
it this is this is this is a miracle my
job title is being asked a person I get
paid around seventy thousand our on like
to tau two hundred thousand dollars for
you the rest of this call was just -
gammatron to justify himself by saying
that I do provide security its customers
but just charge them extra I'm not sure
how this really works when they're
running the refunded IRS scammer so
after seeing what I'd seen hearing what
I'd heard and collecting all the
information that I had I decided it was
a good idea to give one of the directors
Dominick a call and see what he had to
say for himself
hello is that Dominic
yeah you run a company called web duct
solutions yeah you used to be you
whether it's a scam company and I run
multiple different scams targeting the
US Australia and the UK no down from
five seven to eight months well it's a
scam company isn't it Dominic I never
used it well recently me and some
friends gained access to the call
centres computers every single one of
them and got every single piece of
information we could possibly need to
file a police report on this company
because your your information is in the
company info folder on the network drive
although I don't really believe you to
be honest Dominic scammers are
professional lawyers you know alongside
pretty yes right
not necessarily the minute because we've
destroyed all your computers so why is
it still ongoing now why is there a scam
why they're multiple scams running under
your name and pretty thing why is that I
don't know I need to have a look at well
as the director you wouldn't be working
in the call centre I'm guessing you'd
just be basically taking the money for
it you'd be employing people right so
you're telling me that you're not in not
in any way aware that that company is
running scams yeah I'd say it's pretty
obvious that you have your laptop in
that building yeah oh yeah and you
you're not aware of the scams as we tell
them in nineteen and unable to work
tomorrow
but Dominic just just so you know I've
got all the information I could possibly
need on this company yeah it's gonna be
posted all over the Internet
hey why are you dong island island do
you I think you're in denial to be
honest mm-hmm
I'm personally not convinced by anything
he had to say with the amount of
evidence that I've found on this company
and the fact that I tried to scam me
using the refund tactic amount of times
I observed them attempting to scam
innocent people I'd say it's a pretty
certain guess that he's lying there
after all the scammers are professional
liars so this is a part that a lot of
you might might infer what did we
actually do in response when they
started to get wise to the fact that we
were watching their every move we felt
it was appropriate to run the memes
Barras on them unfortunately you won't
really see much point of view of this
when the virus is run the computer is
not really going to do much we just lost
the connection so there's no video of
that book you can quite clearly hear
what happens in the background when the
computer eventually dies
you
as you can see he shot down and what do
you think he heard and saw on the
computer booted up
well this
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
that's wonder after this they all start
trying to restore their systems so the
only response was to run memes on every
single one of them
you
and there goes another one
and there goes the last one that we have
footage off and as before as soon as I
booted back up all they would hear and
see was this
and sadly for us but luckily for any
victims who they might have scammed that
is the end of webbed acts for now all
the information we've collected will be
forwarded to the Indian cybercrime
Police hopefully they'll do something
about it but sadly that is very doubtful

already
oh my god
1700 line failed they changed the number
yes
[Music]
it all started with regular scam baiting
I am not sure if our viewers here are
familiar with it so I give a short
introduction to it
basically we so-called scam betas
purposely fulfill scam and call the
scammer numbers to waste the time and to
annoy them getting to know information
about them infiltrating them and sharing
it on platforms such as scam alert info
it was also scammer info which I was
consulting to find the particular scam
calls in this number it was listed as an
apple scam so I called them and I did
the regular scam baiting they asked me
to connect my iphone to my computer so I
used some old USB flashdrive renamed it
to iPhone 7 reflected in into my virtual
machine then they went ahead and did the
normal fake diagnosis pretending that
they are natural technician and that my
iPhone has been compromised and I need
to purchase a service plan with him in
order to solve the problems
I called them over and over again scam
baited them and eventually after getting
used to me and me earning the trust talk
to many of them about different topics
my Christina lost our video series is
about the same call center for example
eventually other agents opened up to me
and confessed about the scam in the real
company name the company of Petra's and
boss's name
I also researched about them grabbing
their IP address when they were
connected to my virtual machine looking
up the Whois records of their website
and many more things the IP address was
finally the key to the Ryoka Indian
company name they were using different
websites and brand names as the sky is
for the victims so that they can shut
down one of the brands if it got too bad
reputation and just create another
website in another brand name to start
the whole scam over again also it was
harder for the authorities to track them
down if all the victims just have a fake
website and a fake company name that can
vanish at any given time
so the IP address give away their real
Indian company name a costings Infotech
Private Limited which is then used to
look them up on India's Ministry of
Corporate Affairs website through that I
saw some registered address which could
potentially be their real office
location also the owners of that company
red listed their notably Deepak Verma
and come out Verma he'll play an
important role later on I then continued
and searched with several of the
company's phone numbers on the internet
and I stumbled across one post of an
American lady who almost got scammed but
as a result she posted the phone numbers
and all info she had gotten on the
Facebook page of a local police station
I was impressed by the information she
collected as she also had multiple phone
numbers of the scammers and I replied
with on the post with all the info that
I have had including the real Indian
company name across things hoping that
the police can use that info and
investigate and maybe find the US
citizen who's routing the money back to
India it turned out that mentioning the
company name a costings
on that post was the best thing of that
I could have done are already forgot
about her Facebook post when I continued
to research about the call center and
talk with the employees but one day I
got message by Alex Goldman from the
podcast reply on on Gillette media he
has been called called by this call
center and decided to track him down for
his latest episode through one of his
sources he has heard about the name of
costings Infotech but wasn't sure if
it's correct or not so he decided to
message me and to join forces to
research more efficiently in the
meantime I have already made real
friends with ex-employees of this call
center so as a group we discussed many
things in a group chat for example I
learned that they were also running a
process targeting British people their
partner company was assured pensions and
UK pensions reviews as well as money
made simple redress claims and
streetwise marketeer
interestingly the same persons always
appeared as owners of these companies
bushra Ashraf Muhammad Usman Khan which
might be Indian or more likely Pakistani
Arjun but also David's pink antennae
Elizabeth Mori I try to reach those two
which are based in
city of Bradford and West Yorkshire okay
however initially they declined to
comment on the allegations but I called
David recently again and that's where he
answered it's a maze of companies based
in the UK for which costings did accost
into work and contracts needless to say
it was all a scam that UK process is
also what Christina in my video series
was talking about the call centres
rather small or medium in terms of
employee count it has approximately 40
to 50 employees with the high
fluctuation rate another interesting
thing alex found out was that the person
who was working as their money mule in
canada collecting the money was actually
a guy called frances cygwin which a
company called econo soft we know that
they are connected because the qanun
soft is registered as the company in the
UK and you can see active ashraf being
one of the owners
does the name hash sheriff ring a bell
correct he's also registered with a
short money the company that was working
with the costings so they are all
connected even up to the state you can
call the toll-free number on the khan
asaf net and get transferred to an
Indian call centre although I think it's
not a different call centre at least I
didn't recognise any voices anymore in
the United States
accosting showed up as MSS marketing a
company who deducted the money on the
credit card bills so time to get them
into more details with Alex Goldman's
and PJ evokes podcast reply all to all
of you who haven't listened to it
spoiler alert I will be talking about
persons and events happening in the
podcast Canada as introduction from my
call centre visits please check out
their podcast it's two parts of each
like 50 minutes it's super entertaining
a professional produced links will be in
the description so to recap it in few
sentences Alex Goldman received a call
from my castings from an agent named
Alexander Martin this year is him by the
way
even the youtuber and my body and attack
was talking to him in one of his videos
so scammer Alexander Martin opened up to
Alex Goldman after it was clear that
Alex Goldman wouldn't fall for the scam
they talked for a while about video
games and such and then the scammer hung
up Alex Goldman researched a bit and
found out about the costings in Kamiyama
and found his pictures and this is
Kamala Burma the mean-looking guy with a
leather jacket Alex Goldman calls the
costings again and after a long time he
reached scammer agent Alexander Martin
again Goldman showed a pic of Kemal on
his PC to the scammer and now one
important thing happens scammer
Alexander Martin calls Kemal Burma over
to his desk and during the call they
switch the phones you can recognize it
because Alexander Martin always uses the
phrase my goodness and has a faster and
more excited voice than now speaking
Kemal Verma who is very calm and relaxed
probably the picture of Kemal on Alex
Goldman's PC has triggered him to come
over the old man still assumes that he's
talking to Alexander Martin that
explains why he's so confused
that the new Alex Martin is so calm and
different that's sadly one mistake the
podcast has that Alex Goldman has used
the pickles and agent Alexander Martin
and Kemal Burma have one and the same
person which they are not Kemal Verma
invited Alex and PJ to Delhi to answer
some questions
so Alex Goldman and PJ flew to India and
met up with Kamal Burma and tea park the
call center bosses not only did they
meet with the bosses but they also went
and found the calls in the location and
went inside of the building right in
front of the office door so that got me
thrilled I also wanted to see how the
call center looks like after so much
time of investigating and talking to the
same Center especially since I also was
a little bit hoping to see Christina and
maybe also Ana
met my friends the ex-employees of that
call center invited me to come to meet
them to travel around India together I
hesitated a bit because of the risk
involved in such an operation but also
trusting people that I have never met
before in real life but finally I did it
who can resist a proper adventure ready
for departure please keep your seat belt
fastened
so your three tables and person TVs
maybe remind you that all mobile phones
must be stretched off on a side note to
that relax and enjoy your flight
thank you for attention
[Music]
so after arriving at my friend's place
in Delhi obviously huge thanks to them I
can't say it often enough it's always a
big pleasure to be with them and we have
to prepare for going to a costings I've
wrote some kind of greetings card letter
I wanted to drop that letter in front of
the office somehow make them see that
letter so that they know that I also was
there following Alex Goldman and his
task we initially planned to go to the
office in the afternoon when they
wouldn't be in the office yet but
remember due to the time zone difference
in India it's night when in the u.s.
it's daytime so they are working at
night to target the u.s. citizens but
since we were a bit late
we arrived in Punjabi back and the
evening times when it was already
running and the agents are inside the
call centre scamming the victims the
area itself is a pretty good one as far
as I heard Punjabi Bagh is a West Delhi
locality and there are many shops and
businesses in Club Road unlike in Europe
or I guess the United States as well no
matter which time it was the roads were
always quite busy which was a good thing
for us so my friends wouldn't be
recognized that easily however they were
still very nervous and for these reasons
it turns out the building across things
is in has a rooftop where the call
center employees go to smoke and from
the other can look down on the road and
could have seen us potentially we stayed
in the shadows because I stood out as a
foreigner and also my friends has never
excelled oh yes they would also be
recognized at all looking up to the
rooftop we could really see the glowing
red of cigarettes and my friend was
super nervous he told me it's not safe
yet to go inside
this is some costumes
after observing the call center in the
area from the outside for a while we
agreed that I can now take a view inside
my friend stayed outside that close to
it so in case something happens to me he
could inform the police and get help for
safety reasons we both had a set a timer
for ten minutes if I wouldn't come out
before that time he would contact the
police also I had different other safety
measures in place then I went inside I
knew already from Alex Goldman's podcast
that the call centers in the third floor
with a headphone bar in second floor and
there's an elevator and that's on the
third floor outside of the call center
he also a security guard in my mind I
was expecting everything to be bigger
and I thought when I arrived at that
floor I have still time to adjust my
camera to take some pictures and videos
from distance before getting close to
their security guard and approached by
him but it was all different surprised
that I had to engage in a conversation
with a security guard almost instantly I
pretended to search for the headphone by
the dad was directly below us and it was
quite obvious because there was loud
music coming out of it he kept pointing
down since we couldn't speak English
while I couldn't speak properly so I
tried to keep the conversation going but
pretending not to understand that also
gave me the advantage of having more
time to look around and also look
through the glass door of the office
trying to spot faces that I maybe
recognize I stopped recording because
the security guard was pretty close to
me and he could react realise that I'm
filming him now after a few minutes of
conversation a bunch of people opened
the door of the call center from the
inside and joined us to light up some
cigarettes into smoke directly next to
me I could see in their eyes that they
were really surprised to see a foreigner
here and they all looked at me in a very
suspicious way one even joined the
conversation to translate between me and
security guard after he finally told me
that we have one bar was downstairs
I finally got robbed my last reason to
stay here without blowing my cover that
I'm actually Robert to scan later who
has infiltrated their scam company since
many months I was heavily outnumbered
and I didn't know if their security
guard has any type of weapons
in ten minutes we're almost over so I
retreated I went towards the elevator
the man the door was already about to
close I reached into my pockets and I
threw them in the letter that I have
prepared for them I then left the
building as fast as possible to meet
with my friends a few hundred meters
away and safe distance of the course
until would have decided to search from
the outside
he was already worried because I
slightly trip to ten minutes but luckily
he didn't call the police yet we call
the cab and I couldn't resist calling a
costings and asking if they received a
letter hi this is Robert did you receive
the letter I just chopped outside of
accosting store I was just at Club Road
the number one you said I just dropped a
letter at the accosting doors yeah my
name is Robert Robert Smith I'm calling
from Delhi I was just at Sun Java back
road number one in first or above
headphones and I was I was dropping the
letter for across things and the
security guards he picked it up so he
still has it probably hello - Who am I
speaking to
yeah just that Club first number one
Punjabi part yes across things I dropped
it to the security guards who was
because I didn't have much time so and
the security guard wouldn't let me in
anyways I guess I got so much
I think I'm not welcome there I don't
know
did she say what she was saying anyway
hello I went back home to my country but
I couldn't stop thinking about the
costings and camels and white so then in
2018 I went again to India and again to
Delhi this time I wanted to visit
accosting someday time to get a better
footage and also to see more of the area
in daylight
[Music]
I are constants
yeah
[Music]
yeah
different things
molten lager it seems in that they have
already closed
apparently they moved to moti Nagar
another West Delhi locality close by I
went to the Starbucks which is just a
few hundred meters away from the call
center and an order that coffee shot a
pic of the bill and send it to come on
via Facebook and wrote that I was
waiting for him to meet me but no reply
I called him a few weeks later then
and that's when he answered who are you
I'm the guy like who came to your office
like who work together with Alex Goldman
I don't work anymore so who's taking
care for castings now if you don't work
what are you about because you told me
like whenever I'm in India like I should
give you a call and then we can meet I
have no more doubt yeah no more anything
but not don't bother
so I'm don't call me anymore so who
sucking who's on the castings and like
what you do now what happened to ask
costing I am close shut down why I don't
know none of my business
don't bother and I'll go get okay why
you call you invited me to their Alex
Goldman reported this particular call
centre to the FBI along with every
information that we have found about
that he submitted also my contact
information for further reference in
case they have further questions but
until the state they have never
contacted us back we're guests it's
because counseling is just a small fish
in the whole industry and the
authorities don't see enough reasons to
track them down as international
investigations are complex
time-consuming and thus also an
expensive so probably they are still
running a scam but just in a different
location and maybe under a different
name
[Music]
[Music]

was yourself my name's shiraz merza
um i've just had a list call to give you
call a call back and
your colleague was just pulling up some
details and mentioned that there's a
lawsuit against me so
i'm quite concerned and that's the
reason i'm calling you back
okay so can you please help me with your
data for the verification purpose
it's the 28th of april 1975.
1975. and please help me with the last
four digits of your national insurance

um i mentioned to your colleague i don't

i'm just wondering if he could securely
check me some other way so i gave my
uh my address my postcode will that do
yeah please help me with the postcode
it's s613sx
sierra okay x-ray
completely fine so as you know it very
well there is a lawsuit under your name
and you might be knowing and you might
be knowing like for what reason there is
a lawsuit under your name
this is absolute news to me and i'm very
very concerned
very shocked uh and that's why i'm
coming back so i don't know anything
about this
i completely understand when out of blue
you get to know there is a lawsuit and
you haven't got
any documents regarding this but let me
tell you that we have tried uh getting
in touch with you we have uh
tried to send the documents because we
cannot send it directly by a post
we cannot uh leave it in your mailbox or
something
because these are uh way too sensitive
documents
we have to send an officer along with
the document
when you have to sign on the documents
and then the officer will give you the
documents
but in this case you are not available
at your place so i would ask you
just a second on
on october 15 like where were you
probably at home no because uh
the officer was there i guess
yeah it's showing that it was in the
afternoon by
two to three he was there by two to
three and you weren't available at your
place
okay so um can you tell me more about
this case i'd um what's it for
what have i done wrong yeah because let
me tell you that you might be knowing
that
when you file your taxes for your
present records we just accept it
and now for the past records we always
do a statutory audit
and when we get to know all the mistakes
with
not only you but there are many citizens
who are not aware about the mistakes
they have made in the past
but we have got to know about this
situation just because of the reorder we
have done
and in the past years we have seen there
are miscalculations and mistakes in your
tax filing
you're not saying that you haven't filed
your taxes but there are mistakes in
your tax filings and that's the reason
like today you are getting this call
because today is the day when we have to
go ahead with the legal charges and once
we
go to the court with this particular
thing for next
60 to 90 days this case is going to last
and to be very honest for that very
moment your bank accounts
will be frozen the national insurance
number
will be suspended and the benefits which
you are getting or you will be getting
in future will be stopped
so it is really important for you to
tell us like
what exactly you think about this case
what is your intention
do you really want to fight a case
against hmrc or you want to resolve this
case out of the quote ups
no no no i would love to resolve this
case i just don't know what this case is
about that's all
so at the moment what we can do is as
you
are planning to get this case resolved
first of all there are some rules and
regulations
which you will have to follow first that
you will have to clear the outstanding
views which is under your name
which is of two thousand six hundred and
fifty four pounds and twenty seven p
which you will have to clear it today
itself once you clear this news
we will be helping you with a reference
number and tomorrow morning early
morning 10 o'clock we'll be sending
an officer at your doorstep with all the
relevant documents
now she's the one who can explain you
everything in detail
in person and she'll also ques answer
all the questions you have
all the doubts she will be clearing it
for you but the thing is she'll only
give you the documents once you help her
with the reference number
so dwight do i do i pay
do i pay your officer tomorrow
now to be honest you will have to pay it
today itself because
today is the day when we have to go
ahead and issue the resolvement papers
then there are two things which can
happen if i go ahead and submit the
documents in the courthouse
then there would be no one in the whole
territory who can really help you with
the situation
but if you really want me to go ahead
and ask the courthouse people to get
this case resolved
then we will have to show something from
your end that yes you are paying the
amount and clearing this outstanding
views
so this would be a good impression in
front of the courthouse people yes
he is putting in some efforts and he
really care about this particular
situation
so we have to go ahead and make this
particular transaction today itself and
as you say
just wanted to check with you like do
you have a criminal lawyer who can
represent you in case you want to go
ahead and fight the case against hmrc
and no i don't because if you don't have
one as you say
we have a team in the courthouse itself
we have a lawyer who will be fighting
for you in the courthouse who will go
ahead and
issue the resolving papers today itself
so you will have to make the transaction
directly to the lawyers account
and once you make the transaction we
will give you a reference number and
as you know it very well we are setting
up an appointment for tomorrow morning
with all the relevant documents so i
just wanted to
check with you is it possible for you to
clear the outstanding dues
of 2654 pounds and 27 feet today itself
um it's going to be hard but uh i
suppose i'll have to put it on my credit
card
um but can i
and let me also know you that we work on
the data protection act
so we are not supposed to ask you for
any of your credit card or debit card
details
it is really important for you to
understand that government doesn't work
that way we couldn't ask you for any of
your bank details
you're just making a digital transfer
and i believe so you are doing online
banking with your bank is that correct
no it's not you don't do mobile banking
or online banking
no i do but my my online bank account's
been frozen so i need to go to the bank
and
see how to connect that back up again
and uh which bank do you bank with um
can i find out first what this 2 600
pounds is for
because i want to pay it but i want to
know what i'm paying for
yeah this is the outstanding news which
is showing under your account as i have
already told you
this is something which is your
underpaid taxes
now this is your path taxes which you
will be clearing and once you clear this
like we can go ahead and we can issue
your resolve and papers from the
courthouse
okay what happens if i can't pay this
it's your choice because the government
does not really want you to pay this
anyhow because they know it
very well that if you're not able to pay
this once you're found guilty in the
courthouse the courthouse will only give
you 48 hours to clear the penalty fine
which is more than 25 to 30 000 pounds
and also imprisonment for five years
so the government knows it very well
that if you're not paying 2 600 now
like they are really getting a really
good option
and a profit out of you because you will
be paying more than that any
ways so it's your choice because no one
is forcing you even if you tell me right
now that you don't want to pay it we are
not really
going to force you again and again
please pay this please pay this we're
not doing this
if you want to pay this you're saving
yourself you're not going ahead and
doing
something good for government if you're
not paying this any which ways
you are doing something good for the
government because you would be paying
more than 25 to 20 000
so should my payment go directly through
to the government then
because this is not your normal taxes
because even if you go ahead and if you
pay this particular tax the
way you do so nobody is going to accept
it
because there is a criminal case already
we are about to go ahead and freeze
everything you have there
and this is the only way when you have
to go ahead and do a transaction
directly to the lawyer who is fighting
the case for you out there
because he's the one who is going to
convince the jury members and the
courthouse people out there
and i hope you can understand that yeah
absolutely understand that and you know
like i said i really want to work with
you i
want to make make sure that i don't have
any criminal records
um this is come as a shock
i completely understand that and if i
was in your place i would think the same
but at the moment it is really important
for you to understand that how important
it is for you
to remove your name from this criminal
case which is today itself before the
court
closes down so you tell me
right now because this is a monitor and
a recorded line so it is really
important
for you to be honest on this recorded
line so i want you to tell me which band
are you back with
um my bank is with barclays however my
credit card
is with halifax and i've just checked my
balance
and i don't have enough clear on my
card to make this payment in full today
i completely understand by any which way
that you know it very well that we are
not accepting cards at the moment
we will have to do a digital transfer
but then you will have to do online
banking with your backlash
or you will have to do a telephone
banking with your barclays
so could you so are you going to be
sending me through the um
[Music]
once i've phoned my bank up and got the
online banking sorted will you be able
to send me
the account details for the government
for me to make this payment directly
through to them then for my back taxes
yeah because what you can do is i'll be
sending you the bank details for the
lawyer
who is taking care of your case out
there you can directly transfer the
funds so that he can show it to the
coach house people and once you make the
payment for this
we can give you the reference number and
to be very honest there are some rules
and regulations as you have
chosen the option of resolving this case
out of the courthouse so it is really
important for you to stay connected
as you say that you will you will have
to call your bank to
get your online banking sorted out let
me tell you you're not supposed to
disconnect this line but you will have
to put us on hold and then speak to the
band people because if this line gets
disconnected we get a clear intention
from your end that you really wanted to
fight a case against hmrc
and you did not have any intention to
get this case resolved out of the
boathouse
and let me tell you this is an ongoing
investigation so i really do not want
you to involve
any third party because we are thinking
about your reputation if we make it
public
your bank accounts will be frozen that
very moment even if your bank people get
to know that you have a criminal case
there
it is completely against their because
they have a policy if a person has a
criminal
case under him all the money which you
have it becomes there
because this is something which it comes
in their policy
it is really important for you to
understand that the bank people should
shouldn't get to know that there is a
criminal case under your name
if you really do not want your bank
accounts to get frozen no no complete
i get that i get that so what's my uh
what's the lawyer's name that's been
appointed to my case
like i'll be getting it for you because
it will take some time for me to get the
details first i want you to
go ahead and call your bank and get your
online banking sorted out until that
time i'll get the bank account details
do i have um an assigned lawyer to my
case right now
yeah that's the reason because till the
time you're going here and speaking to
your bank
until the time you are going ahead and
getting your online banking sorted out
we are going ahead and taking care of
the paperwork we are just talking to the
judy members
we are here to take care of the
situation the accounting heads are going
ahead
and letting them know that there is a
person who is a really genuine person
the reason we called you as i've already
told you we have done a background check
for you
and we know it very well that you're
innocent person you haven't done
anything wrong
in the past and that's the reason you're
getting this option there are many
people who are really trying but they
are not getting this option
they are really i would say a lucky
person to have this particular option
where you can go ahead and at least pay
the outstanding views and
have your case resolved today itself so
i want you to go ahead and make a call
to your fans without disconnect just
disconnecting this call you can just
keep keep us on hold
and then you can make the call to your
bank and make sure your online banking
is up
once the online banking is up you let me
know so that i can help you with the
bank details
you know the more i think about this the
more i mean me personally i was trying
like i said i was trying to put this on
my credit card i know through data
protection you can't take my credit card
but my credit card's the one that's got
the flexibility for me to be able to pay
this
in my bank account i haven't got 2 600
pounds to pay this
but i have got that on my card
so i want you to tell me on the recorded
line i want to be honest
how much you have in your bank account
right now
um i'm still waiting to get paid in two
days time
so right now right now right now how
much you have 150 pounds
so is it not possible because right now
as you say that you are going to get
paid in two days
so is it possible for you to arrange
this kind of money you can ask some of
your family or friends
to help you with this kind of money and
then you can pay them back up to two
days
unfortunately around christmas time most
people have
got their money tied up on christmas
presents so i don't think i have many
people who
could lend me that kind of money you can
check with them because this is the only
option as you know it very well
because the government is not really
going ahead and waiting for two days for
you to go ahead and have your
payment to get get in place we really
gonna wait that
that much time today is the day when we
have to go ahead and
we have to take action so you need to
understand to the urgency
like how particular situation
before the code closes we have to go
ahead and let them know that yes you
have made the payment of the outstanding
views
so you tell me because i'm oh i'm
holding the line for you
you can go ahead and make calls but let
me tell you that even if you are taking
help from
someone you're not supposed to go ahead
and involve any third party
into this ongoing investigation nobody
gets to know about this situation if we
get to know because your phones are
tapped
we can listen to all the conversation
you are having with anyone out there
and if we get to know that you are
disclosing this confidential matter to
anyone out there
you will have to go ahead with the legal
charges i hope you can understand
so what's the worst case scenario if i
can't pay
i've already told you we don't even
really want you to pay as you told us
that you want to pay this and get this
thing sorted out
we are giving you this option if you
tell me right now that you don't want to
pay this
we are completely okay with it well i
get arrested
sorry will i get arrested if i don't pay
this within next 15 to 20 minutes you
will get arrested
15 is 20 minutes that's correct
because everything is planned to be very
honest like if a person is ready to pay
what will happen and if
the person is not really able to pay
then what what we have to do with them
we we know everything because you're not
the only citizen there are many people
who really want to go ahead and resolve
the matter but then they do not have
that
chance to go in and have the particular
case resolved just because of their
past records so it is really good
as i've told you you're lucky that
you're getting this option to resolve
this case
but then too if you really want to waste
time going ahead and talking about all
these to be really honest this is a
waste of time
i think yeah yeah i have to agree with
you
can i ask you a question though please
what's your real name
my name is ron smith yeah now what's
your real name what's your real name
it's ron smith
your birth name ron smith
and where you calling from
okay you know um
i appreciate you caring for me um
i know my friends and family don't have
this money right now so
i guess the only thing i got to know
what exactly you were doing
so thank you very much
oh don't think you like that one so look
ladies and gents
if you get these phone calls please do
not panic this is probably the
third one i've got now and they will try
it really really hard
and trust me if you're unaware and you
get caught out
you will feel the fear your butt cheeks
may clench up a little bit
when they give you this scare tactic
that they have just given me
i'm going to wait 15 minutes 20 minutes
max
see if i get arrested if i do um
[Music]
i'll let you know from the other side
however i am very doubtful that i'll be
arrested
so just wanted to share this please do
not fall
victim to this [ __ ]
do you have any orders on the way from
amazon if so
you're a prime target for the latest
amazon scam here's what to watch out for
so you don't waste your money
kimberly moore was at her health
administrator job when she received a
strange
call on her cell phone all is regarding
your purchase from amazon.com
you made a transaction of 529 a very
specific amount of money
of a purchase that they wanted to see if
i made but kimberly never made any such
purchase
the automated call then gave her an
option then call this number
because then they need to get it all
straightened out for you but luckily
instead of calling she checked her
amazon account and realized
there was no such 500 order amazon
customers across the country are getting
calls like hers
that order seemed to be fraudulent press
one to talk with amazon frog department
executives
sometimes it's a woman's voice
ftc says if you press one an agent will
ask for the credit card number attached
to the account
don't do it it's all a scam amazon will
email you personally
with your name if there is an account
issue
kim is so glad she checked her account
online before calling that number back
i figured it was a fraud but even still
it was like oh my gosh do
was there 500 and something dollars now
missing from my account luckily
her account was fine still not sure
ask the caller to read your account
number out loud to you
chances are they have no idea what it is
and in that case
just hang up so you don't waste your
money
we wear llamas camel from India nobody
must know who I am
and so he's been working undercover with
a private investigator named Devin in
Canada to warn people who are about to
send all their money overseas someone
called you from here and you told them
that your name was Devon from the anti
fraud squad everyone is scared man
[Music]
today's episode is brought to you by
Harry's I know that a lot of you been
wondering how I got this clean shave
well the answer is Harry's and they're
giving you a great shaving set for only
three dollars when you visit the link in
my description below now I got to tell
you that as a bystander this whole
Indian scam story I'm just as shocked
and as anxious to find out what happens
is all of you are and I'm just as mad
that the Canadian government had this
insider information behind three scam
operations and instead they chose to sit
on their thumbs in fact I found a news
story on YouTube shortly after last
episode about a Canadian journalist who
looked into these scams and he traveled
to India after learning that thousands
of people had complained against their
government check out what he learned so
who is responsible the top cop here
commissioner Paramveer Singh he blames
the RCMP nobody contacted us from Canada
"no one telling me 60,000 people at least"
have complained in Canada and nobody
from Canada knows ability or anything
nobody convicted way to go Canada but
apparently Steve's scam bosses are on
edge after their last stunt got exposed
by the very person that Steve and Devon
were trying to help by the way why does
this always happen in my videos this is
the third person that we've been trying
to help that goes and blows our cover
freakin Jenni blew my cover and now
Steve's bosses are convinced that the
FBI has some crazy new technology and
that they're able to listen in on all of
their calls and it's got them scared out
of their minds because they know that
now there's some guy named Evan who's
hot on their tail so Devon messages
Steve and he tells him to delete his
contact info
any correspondence from his phone
because he knows that if his bosses find
out that Steve and Devon are working
together Steve's a dead man but by the
time that Devon sends that message it
might have been too late they won the
whole thing as top men and and you you
have highlighted me you don't understand
what kind of a mess I'm in man everybody
knows it is me please get back to me my
life is in danger man I mean India man
it's a third world country where they
don't think twice about killing someone
and leaving them in the street to
protect that millions and that
reputation and by the time that Devon
responds to this Steve has gone silent
so Devon keeps messaging hello
[Music]
I'm just kidding I know that you guys
love my cliffhangers but imagine how
Devon felt I mean where was Steve had he
been killed was he being tortured what
kind of a mess had he got himself into
so Devon panics and he calls his contact
with the RCMP and they tell him the
Steve needs to get in touch with the
local authorities in India okay Sherlock
how do you contact the authorities if
you've been kidnapped and so that's how
it was
Steve had gone missing in a country of
1.3 billion people and what was Devon
gonna do this private investigator in
Canada call the Indian Police me you
think nerds gonna take him serious I
mean most of these scam centres are
paying the cops to look the other way
and six days had passed and Devon heard
nothing he was convinced that Steve was
dead and the DES story had come to a
depressing conclusion until he got a
whatsapp message from an unknown number
hello stranger long time no speak-o it's
your long-lost friend from India Steve I
finally got access to an Internet phone
and looked you up I thought I'd send you
a message and see how you are
well after we tried to save that girl
and she ratted us out they sent us home
for the day so I was waiting for my bus
ride when two of the guys I work with
pulled up in a shitty car and asked if I
wanted to ride home stupid me I said yes
and those cos knew something was going
on
it really got heated in the car man
you know they stole my phone and they
forced me to give them my email
credentials they pushed me out of the
car on some King Street I don't know
where I was and they kept my phone so I
couldn't reach you or anyone for help
man I was scared I I didn't know what
was going to happen so I was laying low
and looking for another job
things are much better now though I have
a new job and I have managed to get a
new phone with some minutes to text you
so Steve had managed to escape his call
center and the wrath of his suspicious
bosses and he had managed to get another
job at a call center that he eventually
learned was also running tax scams at
night including the Social Security scam
in the United States and he knew that he
needed to do something more and this
brings us to present-day where Steve
reaches out to me the guy on YouTube
hello Ben
you're a very hot bosom to get hold of
for the last year Steve and Evan have
fried saving people one time what does
it cost to hang up they've tried getting
call centers rated authorities which is
totally disinterested and they've tried
getting the government involved nobody
contacted
but they've hit a brick wall so here we
are wondering what we're gonna do next
and we think that we have a pretty good
idea so over the last few weeks Steve
Devin and I have been thinking about our
next million how we're going to fight
back
and so we are turning to you people of
the internet we need everybody's help on

go ahead go ahead what's this what's
this information
five nine listen to me carefully yes sir
yes four one two four one
so so listen to me sir we're here to
read you that the reason is that
your social security number using some
other guy in a state of taxes
for the illegal activity so that's the
reason we try to reach you
and investigate you you are not that
person and you not doing that
so we try to help you further understand
sir i will
explain why each
so let me go ahead and explain the
situation about this case but before
that i would like you to inform you that
the line on which we are talking to each
other at this moment
is totally being regarded by ssa and dea
which is drug enforcement administration
department
so as you know that whatever you will be
saying will be used as statements
i understand i don't know why the dea is
involved but i understand what you're
saying
sir so so the investigation started
under your name and under your social
security number
when the us marshals patrolling team
have recovered an abandoned car
from the south border of texas it was
black collect toyota corolla with
registration numbers
txn7845 and they also recovered some
kind of blood
and drug residue inside it when the us
marshal
investigate continued they got to know
that the car recovered by them was
fraudulently rented under your name and
under your social security number
so this is where the very first thing
which basically has gone wrong under
your social security number
so these people have been very
successful so far and stealing and
copying personal information
and using it flawlessly for a different
kind of illegal activities
and there was also an address linked
with the title of vehicles
an address from the city of el paso in
texas was also raided by us marshall by
help of locals al fasor police
department
when the u.s marshal raided that
president there was no one inside the
resident at that time
but we have recovered approximately
around 22 pounds of cocaine
which i hope you know is highly abusive
drugstore and some moreover from
different documentation from different
financial institutions
have also been recovered under different
people's name including you
so as i told you that these people have
been stealing and copying the personal
information of different innocent people
and they have been using it for
relevantly for different kind of illegal
activities
and now what they have actually done is
they have opened up several bank
accounts
under different people's name including
you and more over thousands of dollars
have been wired from these bank accounts
locally and internationally which
totally seems suspicious to us sir
so this is something which is going
wrong under your social security number
and this is something which is required
to be resolved as soon as possible
so we are considering this case as a
straight case of drug trafficking and
money laundering that is the reason this
kind of joint investigation
is being conducted by social security
administration in texas and drug
enforcement administration department in
washington
so now before i proceed any further i
would like you to ask
if you have any question or any queries
for me at this time then you can
ask please my question to you justin is
how do i help you get um
get this out of my way so i don't have
to worry about it
yeah so that's why i'm asking so now i
would like you to tell you guys
so this is uh in this regard we have
already looked into your past records
we have found out that your banking
contains general records and your social
have no other
complaints in the past so this is the
only main reason
we have tried to reach you before you
face any legal consequences
i understand what do you need me to do
yes sir
sir that's why listen to me sir so that
i want to ask you if you're willing to
work with the social security
administration along with the dea
investigation only then we we would be
able to put your case file and arrest
warrant on hold
and we should be able to find the real
culprit who have been misusing your and
other innocent people's information and
committing
criminal activities in the state of
texas so what's your fair intention that
what you really want to do what you want
to do get
go to the trail or for that reason that
you didn't commit or you want to verify
yourself and take your name out of this
queso so justin tell me what i need to
do to clear my name from this case
okay so now to help you further with
this now what i'm going to do for you is
i'm going to follow up an asset
verification form under your name and
under your social security number
so let me explain you what does actually
mean and why is required to be filled
under your name first of all sir
i'm not sure if you know or not but the
u.s treasury is an authorized department
who investigates
on all these kind of case cases like
money laundering and drug trafficking so
what i'm going to do
is i'm going to fill up an outstanding
verification form under your name
it's in which i will be verifying and
validating the asset which you have
under your name and under your social
security number
and that they can and that information
will be sent further to the u.s treasury
so that
they can differentiate between the
information which we which we have
recovered from the
state of taxes and which you have
already have under your name so that
they can make sure
none of the assets and none of the
information we have recovered from the
state of taxes
belongs to you you understood that so i
do understand that
so now before i before i providing any
further
details one more thing which i feel very
important to explain is that
as a federal community executive and as
agent of social security administration
i'm not authorized allowed or interested
in taking any of your personal
information over this federal government
regardless
for example like your accounting number
your routing number or any other details
like that
so basically whatever the question i
will be asking you for you
will be just for a basic knowledge of
this case so that the information could
be for helpful for you
as well for us well get your name
removed from these kind of cases you
understand that so i do understand
justin
okay so so where are you currently
living sir do you own any kind of
property under your name or you are
rented any property like any kind of
flag
i meant house i do not own a house and i
do not rent property i'm living in a
basement of my daughter's house
narration just for clarity
pretty much everything i tell justin is
an absolute lie
okay so can anybody find me the uh
addresser

home i'm just living here right now
probably next week we'll go move into

zip code sir

not my home
i don't know the zip code give me one
minute let me see if there's a piece of
me this is not your home
so i understand this is not your home
and that's why i'm asking after all the
investigation done so we can send a
letter

about that
zip code 29601
29601 yup

okay so which other financial institute
you are currently banking with like any
kind of bank you're currently banking at
this
point of time
there's no bank it's just paypal justin
do you use paypal
okay okay so so sir what would be the uh
what would be the approximate value in
your paypal sir i think there's probably
about maybe
300 in there
okay so justin am i the only one that's
involved this is sound like you got a
lot of your
other agents are making the same phone
calls are there a lot of people's caught
up in this

i'm verified verification is in that
case so we can save all these
information to the call tray

please
sorry is it possible to talk to
complaints
yeah absolutely just hold the line thank
you
yes i can hear you go ahead yeah um i'll
just receive the phone call regarding
the price price of amazon's price
this is absolutely ridiculous
jumping from seven dollars a month to 99
a month
why is there such a price rise you
understand what is
do you understand why the price got
increased
i don't understand why this why there is
this price right
let me let me tell you the account
basically which
they're using for so long time for the
past couple of
weeks we see that your account has been
login multiple
times from a different different users
like except yourself
we see that two to three other users
present on your computer network
now the reason why we called here
because we are suspecting that this uses
which is present on your amazon account
has been present without your
authorization that is the reason we call
here so that we can able to go ahead and
cancel all the services
and also block those other users which
is present on this account
because you do understand amazon prime
is for only one person
if it's getting for two to five
three other person except yourself
the price automatically got increases
and i haven't no one else uses it i've
gotten on my playstation my phone and
through your laptop
okay because where we see over here the
amazon prime services has been activated
on your account and it's been used by
two to three other
users except yourself that is the reason
it is mega suspicious and that's why
you're talking with amazon in the
recorded line right now
how can you so that we can rectify it
and who are the other
how can you definitely someone else
other than me using it
when i pick up another phone log into my
account use it
because what we see over here that
whenever someone else log into your
account we get the notification
through the server that is the reason we
call the office yeah but that's me
logging into my own account here you are
that doesn't make any sense did you
did you share your uh id password of
your amazon account with anyone else
no i have not
using your account without your
knowledge and your authorization
so that's why we need to go ahead and

bullcrap jumping from seven dollars to
ninety nine dollars

my motive was to do anything wrong with
you i would not have sent you any
security warning on your screen
if anything goes wrong while being on a
call with us you can just report it to
the better business bureau no issue sir
is in a call center in kolkata located
in the east indian region of west bengal
they are running an amazon refund scam
and are one of the dirtiest call centers
when it comes to spying methods and
silently stealing from victims by using
their devices when the victim
leaves it unattended i've been watching
these guys for a few weeks now
and even made a video on them before if
you haven't seen that video i recommend
watching it first so you better
understand what i'm going to show you
today
after that video of shutting down some
of their machines with malware
they continue their scams very quickly
the next day i re-spread my access
through the network to the connections
that i lost and continue monitoring
their scams
hello we are checking in our server that
you have made
a purchase of iphone 11
2l worth rupees 1499
so you want to accept the order or want
to cancel the order
okay you have one to cancel the order we
will provide you a cancellation form
just fill it up
and your order will be cancelled oh sir
oh just we will take your five to ten
minutes to cancel or
just you have to sit in front of your
computer or laptop we will
give you a cancellation form when the
scammer asks this question
if the victim has a computer or phone
there's three roads the scam can take
from here
the first option is that the victim says
that they do not have a computer or
phone
and usually when they say this other
scammers that i've watched in the past
give up so first of all let me know one
thing ma'am do you have a computer or a
laptop
even you don't have a laptop or uh you
don't have a smartphone
okay so this call is not for you okay
these cameras though
are very persistent and have adapted to
the fact that some people don't own
technology for them to take remote
access of for the following clip i'm
going to show you
we are going to listen to the senior
manager on the floor who can be
identified by his deep
and distinguishable voice whenever an
agent in the call center gets close to
scamming a victim
he walks over to their computer and
takes over the call to finish the
business
how do you check it do you do any kinds
of online banking okay
let me tell you it will not reflect in
your banking statement
right now it will reflect after 48 hours
because it's a 3d payment so after 48
hours if you come to us
we will be able to help you so now as
you don't have any kinds of device
so i cannot send you the money online
okay
into your bank because you don't even do
online banking
all right so what i'll be doing is i'll
be giving you the money
in the form of gift card so that you can
collect the cash
no sir after this call disconnects we'll
we cannot hold up the money i'll
i'll explain you everything you can take
me as your grandson what the scammer
said there
take me as your grandson is one of the
many little things he keeps saying
during calls with victims he tries to
put them at ease by saying stuff like
take me as your grandson
i will be here with you throughout the
whole process don't worry take a deep
breath
calm down at the same time though he
also puts a lot of pressure on the
victim in a non-aggressive way
by saying it has to be done within 48
hours and that if the victim hangs up
the phone
he will lose all of his money all this
plays a huge factor in the success rate
of scammers
and this specific guy was verbally
strong and had a deep voice which is
scientifically proven to make people
trust you easier it's not a surprise why
he
is a higher up in this company and why
he gets to scam a lot of people
successfully as well
just let me know one thing that do you
drive yeah so that you can collect the
cash
so do you have a nearest walmart or a
cvs pharmacy or
a family dollar or a dollar general you
live close to the walmart
okay and for all security reasons before
the money was taken out
what was the last balance you had on
your card
before the money was taken out so that
we can mark you as safe
calm down calm down take a deep breath
i'm there with you don't panic
okay just give me a rough count like is
it more than thousand or less than
thousand the scammer asks the victim
how much money is in his account so that
he knows how much he can steal from him
they will always try to get as much
money per victim as possible
and usually try to rip the victim off
for their entire savings account the old
man
initially replies that his debit card
has about 200 on it which
in the scammer's eyes is not enough
money to steal from him and you bank
with only
one bank or you bank with any other
bankrolls
what was the last balance you remember
on the second bank
now let me tell you those hackers have
overdrafted your that bank
okay which which had 800 dollars so they
have taken out your 800
plus they have over drafted it your
account is a minus 1500 so don't worry
i'm giving you your money back so
what i'll do is on your second bank
which has which you just now told me
with the balance of 800 i'm adding up a
credit line
of a thousand dollars are you getting me
and that's that's a credit line
which you have to use in the walmart and
purchase
apple gift card for a 500 yes with not
your money sir
because you don't have any money right
now i have added a credit line
and i'll be there with you unless and
until you receive your cash
so don't worry you can take me as your
son it's your own hard-earned money
right
i do believe you want your money back
luckily this victim did not fall
for the supposed credit line that was
added to his card and hung up the phone
not everyone is as cautious as this man
though
these cameras were actually quite
successful at scamming people
especially when the victims did own a
device that the scammers could take
remote access off this brings me back to
our game tree
the second and third option are that the
victim does admit to having either a
phone
or a computer the phone method is very
similar to that of not having any device
the scammer will simply try to steal
money from the victims payment apps like
that from bank of america
cash app paypal and many more and the
zell is the application through which
this hackers have used
means okay we'll transfer you the funds
okay so just go ahead and write down
the cell phone number of the sender
first
over here no no no this is our billing
manager number
whom you will send the request then he
will send you the funds
okay go give a click on send
yeah give a click on send money to this
give a click on it you're sending the
request money as you could see
the scammer was pretending like it was a
money request even though it clearly
said
send money the victim complied but
because all of our balances were
negative the payments didn't go through
one of our accounts even had a balance
of minus nine hundred thousand dollars
which i had never seen before
scammer then tried the same sole payment
method with this email
and also with this email i reported all
this information to zell and they took
down the accounts for me
they tried to steal money from several
different apps like bank of america
wells fargo american express and her
paypal after 45 minutes of messing
around
they finally gave up this particular
victim did not have any money and the
scammers weren't very happy with this
listen to me you're all the accounts are
closed and your accounts are corrupted
in this
i'm adding a thousand dollar credit line
which you have to use
and purchase the gift card with our
money go back and swipe your screen down
mom [ __ ] you ma'am go back to your
paypal
okay now swipe your thumb i mean
just scroll the page down mom open the
paypal
how much balance do you have in this one
nothing
okay nothing
nothing okay like you don't have any
money in any of your cards right
it's zero wonderful right and how much
how much credit is available on this e e
n inc
30 or 40.
i called the victim up to let her know
everything about the scam and that the
scammers could still spy on her with the
any desk and teamviewer application that
they made her install
through the app store about they're
trying to steal your money they're not
actually from amazon
they are located in india in a scam call
center and they're trying to steal your
money
yeah okay good thank you i mean i
thought i knew that but i guess i
didn't if anyone ever calls you from a
big company like amazon
social security like asking you for gift
cards asking you for access to your
devices no it's a scam
thank you so much thank you very much oh
my god i'm really grateful thank you the
computer method is the same as most
other refund scams
i'm not going to waste too much time
showcasing this because i already
analyzed this method in my last video
but just to give you a very quick run
through
they have this refund portal which i
found on most of their computers the
victim has to fill out their information
once they have to type the refund amount
the scammer types an extra zero
and pretends like the victim made that
mistake and now has to give the money
back to the scammers made a mistake
so you have to you know refund the money
back to us
you can take 1500 and the rest of the
money you can refund us back
and can you tell me like how far is your
bank from your home
this particular victim was an 86 year
old lady that could not pay the scammers
back
because she did not have a cell phone
she could not drive to a store or a bank
and she was physically disabled so she
couldn't even walk like what is the
problem what is the major issue like why
[Music]
[Music]
86 year old disabled lady and they still
tried for one hour and 48 minutes to get
money from her through her laptop
for this they tried several different
websites like moon pay binance coinbase
and moneygram
but none of them seemed to really
satisfy them but then they realized that
the woman had a webcam
and they said this
[Music]
would packs perfect for them they could
steal the victim's identity through her
laptop webcam
and register an account with her debit
card linked to the account to empty your
savings account luckily she wasn't a
blocked jurisdiction
so paxful didn't work scammers didn't
know what to do at this point and were
even struggling to complete a simple
puzzle to prove they weren't robots
you have to slide slide the puzzle you
know yeah
yeah leave your mouse okay in your mouth
do not touch your mouth
hello you have to move the puzzle in the
middle okay now stop
stop after almost two hours the victim
was rightfully getting impatient
and mad at the scammers but they were
just laughing at her
ma'am is there any cell phone with you
like
in your family member
okay okay okay just keep calm and relax
all right hold on at this point the
scammers were so desperate to steal
something from the victim
that one of them even tried to buy
himself a phone plan which revealed his
real phone number to me of course she
tried to buy the most expensive pack
with the victim's money she kept saying
that she was going to hang up
but she ended up never doing it i
decided to shut down her computer from
the scammer's end while they were not at
the computer and at that point i could
call the victim and warn her about the
scam
and she wasn't very happy with me
calling either hey hear me man
yeah yeah i just wanted to warn you the
guys you have been talking to for the
past
two hours are trying to scam you what
they were trying to steal money from
from you through your uh laptop they
were trying to sign you up with all
all types of crypto companies and trying
to steal your money
thanks now
who actually are these scammers during
the weeks that i was watching them
i found some clues on the identity of
these cameras the first thing i found
was an alliance broadband
voip portal registered on the real name
of one of the scammers his full name
as you can see is sanji he is probably
one of the higher ups in the company
since he pays the bills for their call
center which we can see from this
invoice this webpage
also reveals the scam call center's
exact address and is located in a tower
on joppur garden number 214
in kolkata west bengal india the second
clue i found
i was one of the scammers always coming
in early into the call center before
everyone else's shift started
he was always on one of the computers
doing work on something called
srt fb append he was adding categories
to wikipedia pages for some money i was
doing this work
with his real name in the logs of the
computer he always worked on
i found the email address and password
for this srt app and web page
and also his personal gmail account with
his personal password his name
as you can see from his email is the
other two pieces of information i found
were two phone numbers one that we saw
earlier when the scammer tried
purchasing himself a phone plan
and one other number that i found when
one of the bosses of this operation
opened his whatsapp web he did this to
try and download a file that somebody
else sent him that was called
usa fresh old age with 86 000 people in
the list that were at least 75 years old
and potential scam victims the
information in a list
included stuff like their full name
email address phone number their home
address and much more information on the
potential victims
now that we have all that information
about the scammers and their scams
let's do some destructive work i'm going
to start off the destruction by
completely shutting down their phone
system
and corrupting all the settings in the
admin portal for the phone settings to
accomplish this i did the following
things to their phone system for the
report section
i messed up the settings in their
visibox which corrupts their entire
phone system
i then deleted all user accounts which
makes it impossible for the scammers to
log in and continue scamming i then
deleted all their calling campaigns
statuses hotkeys leads auto-odd dials
and acc ids which stops their robocalls
and deletes all the settings of these
robocalls on the list section i then
deleted all their lists
i deleted all their scripts on the
script section i deleted all their
filters
and for the inbound section i deleted
their showing groups their dids
their call menus and their filter phone
groups then finally for the remote
agents i deleted all the remote agents i
deleted the extension groups
in the admin section i changed all the
passwords for the login to the user
accounts and to the admin account so the
admins cannot log into the admin account
to restore the settings then i changed
their call times their shifts
i deleted their phones their templates
their carriers their servers and their
conferences and then messed up the
system settings
i deleted all the system statuses i
added a voicemail which warns victims
and somehow might still get through when
calling the number which i don't think
is possible and i also changed their
whole music to the same thing
now let's see what the scammers thought
of this corrupt system hello
hello you are an eagle
bye
[Music]
this side can't be reached
and now it's time to destroy the
computers in this call center with the
nj alarm screen locker malware
and change all the scammers their
backgrounds to the fbi logo to freak
them out

antivirus on here because I did a clean
install I didn't do the upgrade let me
check that out and when did you install
the Windows 20 computer sir
two days ago yesterday yeah
how much Amano did you pay for Windows
10 that you have installed Microsoft's
website and I used to see put it in a CD
and then I installed install it's free
means that you don't have the genuine
Microsoft Windows am i right yeah you
have just installed a free trial version
to your computer yeah what exactly you
are doing in this computer so like this
is your personal computer
do you have any kind of a business what
exactly you are doing in this computer
oh no I just use it to browse the web
then stop and check my emails going to
Facebook
fee bills and all that yeah so are you
benefit these things what these are in
the computer right now that I'm showing
you that these files just a lot in
common so let me show you what exactly
these files are okay
have a look [ __ ]
yeah what's all Greek I can't reason
that similar little I also can't read it
no sure I can't read it because it is
something this is something Spanish to
me actually sir what happened these
things that you have in the computer
right now all these are the junks okay
these are the infections to a computer
these are the infections like this junk
file yeah like in network junk okay like
you told me that you have restore you
have installed new windows but these are
the junk infections say computer because
once you install a new windows the
computer said you are going to use your
emails we are going to use the same
thing okay now have a look and do you
have any idea about this one what it is
like are you and DLL 32 dot eh no I
never heard of that I will show you that
what exactly this is okay just alarming
on it let me show you what I did say
this is the computer sir
I did it with me yeah I get that every
time I open up the browser
yeah I see that please go ahead and
review lines for me the first one other
instances of run DOL 32 dot exe rundell
32 dot exe is a process registered as a
backdoor vulnerability which is a stowed
for the malicious purpose of an attacker
a lot of noxus to the computer from
remote location still password internet
bank and personal data this processes
security risk it should be removed from
your system you got my point what
exactly those files are there in the
computer sir all these things are junk
in a malicious file stay computer as you
told me that you are using this computer
for paying bills ok like you're using
this for emails but you don't have any
external protection to a computer
although you're using a in business
security that the Microsoft revives you
you have a Windows Defender in the
computer ok that the Microsoft provides
you but if the Windows is not genuine
then I don't think that the Microsoft
you know the Windows Defender will help
you in that case you got my point
let me check some other details of your
computer as well then I will tell you
what needs to be get done in a computer
sir ok all right
look at the computer sure yeah did you
stop this application Qi computer like
stop stop see also all this sort of
stuff in the computer did you stop these
services then who stopped the services
Jakob yourself who did that so how old
Microsoft can stop these dead services
to a computer how many computers do you
have actually you know you're facing
this problem and just in one computer
yeah and you're all the computer
connected to the same network the same
Internet service provider yeah sure if
they all are connected to the same
service provider I am so sorry just say
you're bad but if you have this kind of
a Junction malicious profile in a
computer in this computer so possibly
you have similar kind of a Junction
malicious files in your other computer
as well because these are the network
transferrable infections sure that's not
that's not good at all
okay all right
now let me go ahead and let me check the
driver part of your computer as well
okay now I will tell you what needs to
be get done okay
have a look
did you stop these drivers to your
machine sir no the same same as the what
you did earlier I haven't stopped any of
these someone is trying to make changes
to your computer sir because if these
know a lot of drivers are stopped in the
computer and you don't and I don't think
that you have a that IP address
protection in a computer as well do you
have an IP address protection I will let
you know sir what is an IP address
prediction
have a look sir
local address s see sir I sometimes get
natural to some server do you know do
you remember the name of the server that
what the server Isaac lays this one
because it's your computer it's your
computer your computer is trying to
connect to the server the foreign server
do you remember the name like you are
trying to connect to someone else like
someone else is trying to connect to
your computer because the IP address is
not you are right now because you're
using someone else's
she said what happens if if like at some
point of his time if the IP address is
not secure what happened
some foreign addresses are trying to
connect with your computer once they get
the connection once they made the
connection to a computer so they are
trying to make the changes to a computer
whatever changes that so they are trying
to make that to your computer okay and
your computer that whatever that you are
doing in the computers up that cannot

activity so if you want to know about
this case just press 1 thank you well if
you get this and if you press 1 or call
the number back you'll be connected to a
government agent who tells you that you
need to pay a fee to get your record
expunged or you could end up going to
jail now do you think that people really
fall for this kind of thing this Social
Security call scam is already up to 19
million dollars for the year ending
March 31st apparently they do but who's
behind it where are they located and
what motivates them to do something so
terrible to someone well I got an email
the other day from a guy named Steve
that might just help us answer this
question it says message me on whatsapp
I'm in India seeing you on YouTube maybe
you could help me or I can help you I'm
at work so I can't talk in detail but
please do message me we'll explain
everything on whatsapp and I thought
okay Steve I'll bite so I sent him a
whatsapp message and I said hello and I
immediately started getting whatsapp
voice messages from him hello Ben love
you you're a very hard person to get
hold of now I'm just gonna be upfront
with you guys and tell you that this is
not the actual recording that he sent me
on whatsapp I actually transcribed his
messages and I hired some dude on
fiverr.com to reenact it I wasn't even
allowed to put like a distortion effect
on his voice because this guy says if he
gets identified he's a dead man
well I'm a scammer from India and this
and I'm involved in his Social Security
Administration the SSN scam where he
scam Americans for their thousands of
dollars
nobody must know while
so here I am talking on whatsapp to a
scammer in India who's been stealing
thousands of dollars from people in the
United States and Canada he's probably
wondering why I'm protecting this guy
you're probably wondering why don't I
just expose this piece of crap and let
his scammer friends tear him to pieces
well just hear me out
actually hear him out I look for people
this is the only job I can find that me
as well but it's scamming people
unfortunately and when I say pay as well
I don't mean pay as well
I mean survival it's hand to mouth you
know I don't own the Mercedes CLK I
don't know none of that
I live on rent and I'm surviving
can you imagine clocking the work every
day knowing that you're about to cost
someone their entire life savings I said
to him can you really not find a job in
India where you can do legitimate work
basically been English to a high level
then that is a job scam scam scam even
the genuine businesses have a room in
the building where there is a scam going
on
he says everything over there is a scam
he tells me that this is the best paying
job that he can find and it only pays
$150 a month it sounds like he's telling
the truth
and that's why I'm willing to protect
his identity for now but how could I
know if he's for real I told him to show
me some proof that what he's saying is
true okay you see my phone is not a very
good for one it's such fun the only
thing I can do is send messages and
receive messages I can't receive calls
about video proof I don't mind doing
that but making a video on my phone
it's it's a phone the camera is not very
good like I told you my job is survival
man
we don't have luxuries people that we
work for they have the BMW's and
dimensions and the pearly gates outside
their house I'll try to get a copy of my
script yes what is involved in my script
and basically that is what I will try to
send you a script so Steve was able to
come through with a couple secret photos
of the call center where he worked as
well as copies of his script this is
what he and his co-workers read as soon
as they get someone on the line so now
we're gonna find out if this script is
legit or not we're gonna experience a
day in the life of an Indian scammer I'm
gonna call this call center and pretend
like I just got a robo call telling me
that my social security number has been
suspended one of Steve's co-workers is
going to answer and we're gonna see if
the script matches hi I got a call from
this number about my social security
number and something about me being
arrested it's been over for me do ve or
mr. Bober I'm officer Jones from the
investigation Department of Social
Security a situation could you please
verify me your address first
I sure it's 9:05 East 500 south in Salt
Lake City
what do you mean sure I promise I would
never do anything illegal your social
security number was misused in the state
of Texas and Social Security
Administration a law enforcement agency
for a bank account and 16 credit cards
you shouldn't use for Blanke using your
social security number for committing a
fraud of more than 10 million dollars
and these accounts were endorsed in
criminal activities like money
laundering and for the IRS tax cans all
over the USA we have to involve your
local fleet department this and I
believe that they do not tend to contact
a per for a local police department yeah
that sure let me find it give me the
number for a local fleet it's eight zero
one five six eight seven seven seven
eight I hear their wings are pretty good
well you can call the police yourself
you scamming piece of garbage okay this
is crazy Steve is the real deal but
here's what makes him different than
most scammers some time ago a person
report at the call centers number to a
website called stop calling me CA now
this website is run by a private
investigator that I'm gonna refer to as
Devon well Devon call him the number and
he got connected to Steve and Devon
confronts
and Steve ends up telling him his whole
story and Devon has sympathy on him so
Devon tell Steve the scammer that he'll
pay him $100 for every victims phone
number that is about to fall for the
scam Basheer's here's how the program
works when you find that one of your
other callers have somebody on the line
that they're scamming and they're about
to scam them you using what that or
something of their liking you need to
get the phone number to me if you get
that phone number to me and I'm able to
call that customer and stop them from
being scammed
I send you $100 so for the past year
every time Steve saw a victim about to
wire their money he would send Devon a
message that's the number
saber saber this woman is saying she's
got 96 thousand dollars in the bank and
they're going to take every single
dollar of it then Devon would make the
call hey you're I'm hoping you just hung
up on those revenue scammers did you oh
my god are you serious will you tell me
you didn't give them any money
no I didn't good item investing in
running Windows just if they're getting
everybody
you're my hero no I did not give them
money I fished it why the entire time
listen I'm really trying to get out of
you like anything I was in it saying I
was gonna go to jail they have a POS
freaking not gonna happen not gonna
happen
don't go to jail none of that it's all
the scam don't be because you're not
going to jail
[Music]
okay okay
holy crap this is really heavy stuff I
see at least Taulbee people for
thousands of dollars but no one was
interested in our story about how we
were saving people and really nothing
came out of it you know and then we just
stopped doing it at the end of the day
I'm not getting anything from saving my
friend used to send me some money but
obviously he's sending it from his own
pocket and couldn't do it
you know all the time
we will we hit a dead end and right now
basically that's about it really
right now right now you are our last
hope of me living a better life and me
getting out of this [ __ ] that I do
that makes me think I am doing something
wrong because yesterday that was a
customer who said I just lost why few
weeks ago I am looking after my daughter
who's 15 years old I hung up on him you
know
I just hang up it's a scam I knew it was
wrong what I was about to do to him
things like that I do feel bad for some
people man and there's some people who I
who have been like you've taken their
hard-earned money I do feel bad for what
I've done to them but I have to do a job
you know I have to put food on my people
I have to provide for my wife that's the
way life is right now
I need to do what I need to do and Devon
and Steve have been trying to get
journalists to cover this story for over
a year they've tried to generate
awareness and get authorities involved
but no one was interested in the story
and so now they're coming to me but Ben
I will say please contact Devon speak to
him and like I said this must stay
between the three of us and and no one
else yeah Devon will verify everything
that we have done but how we hit a brick
wall just confirm to me that you will be
contacting him so I can tell him that
you are going to speak to him
this is the story of the century and I'm
going to tell the whole world on YouTube
but first I've got to get ahold of Devon

"A CBC News Marketplace
 investigation"
"has led now to the arrests
of dozens of scammers in India."
"People who have bilked Canadians
out of millions of dollars"
"and they are some of the people
behind the annoying robocalls"
"that claim to be from
the Canada Revenue Agency-"
"you know those calls, they
threaten you with a lawsuit"
"if you don't pay them
thousands right away."
"David Common was here,"
" and we watched his
 initial investigation,"
" began the season for
 Marketplace."
"That investigation has led to
these significant developments"
"so David,
thanks for coming back,"
"and telling us more about
what has happened."
"Well Heather, over about
the past ten days,"
"there have been at least
two major raids"
"against some of these
scam centres,"
"from which these calls
go out."
"And when you receive
them at home,"
"it doesn't look like
they're calling from India,"
"they use call spoofing,
which allows them to look like"
"they're calling not only
from Canada,"
"but sometimes from a legitimate
Canadian phone number."
" When Indian police, at the
 behest of the RCMP and the FBI,"
" went into these call centres,
 they made dozens of arrests,"
" and at the same time found
 a list- lists, in fact,"
" of more than 600
 Canadian names."
" Those are believed to be some
 of the victims of this scam,"
" and so the RCMP are now going
 to begin the process"
" of contacting all
 of those people,"
" to try to hear their side
 of the story."
" In terms of the remaining
 call centres,"
" and there are many of them
 that still exist,"
 the RCMP has a clear message.
 Here is Inspector Peter Payne
" with the Financial Crimes
 division."
"Peter Payne: We,law enforcement
 in Canada,"
"international law enforcement
as well,"
"we are not going to stop,"
"we are going to continue
our efforts,"
"jointly, collaboratively,
until we take you down."
I would just point out
"that the RCMP have been tracking
this file for quite some time,"
"we did do a story,
they acknowledged that"
"that helped move this issue
to the front burner,"
"certainly get more public
awareness in law enforcement,"
"and government, for this,"
"but we also know the FBI have
been very strong on this,"
"and there's some indication
the FBI may well have"
"been involved in some
of these raids, as well."
Some sort of collaboration.
"So you mention the names
on the list found, 600,"
"we know there are thousands
of Canadians over the years"
"bilked out of ten million
dollars, is the figure"
"that we've been talking about,
at least ten million dollars,"
"just in recent years, will
any of the people scammed"
get any of their money back?
"Yeah you know, if I got
a phone call from the RCMP,"
"and I'd been
a victim of this,"
"that'd be the first
question I'd ask,"
"and the answer right now is-
they hope to,"
"but they are making
no guarantees."
"This is an early stage
in the investigation."
" Part of the challenge is
 the money that disappears"
" actually goes through
 financial intermediaries,"
" and some of it is
 lost already there"
" before the scammers themselves
 even get it."
" So how much money is left over?
 Is a big question."
" Another big question- these
 calls are going to continue,"
" people are going
 to get them, today,"
" so what do you do if
 you get the call?"
 Quite simple.
" If someone calls from
 the Canada Revenue Agency,"
" identifies themselves as that,
 and they threaten you,"
"they threaten you in any way,
with arrest or anything else,"
hang up.
"The CRA very rarely calls
people, and when they do"
"they certainly do not
arrest people ."
"If that is the threat,"
goodbye.
"The strangest thing is that
I've had a couple of the calls"
since your investigation-
I don't doubt it.
#NAME?
"And I'm sure I'm not alone.
So hang up, do not acknowledge,"
"do not do any of
the things suggested."
"David, thank you very much,
lots of great things happening"
" as the result of
 your investigation."
 David Common.

money from the savings to the checking

okay
what do you want me to do
so i would give you a couple phone

that's not really a problem
hello this is matilda
yeah i'm speaking to matilda sweetwater
yes this is matilda sweet while i'm
speaking
hello
uh mr matilda this is mark from dr z old
books clinic how are you doing today oh
oh hi mark
you know i think i i think i just got a
call from this number i'm sorry that i
missed your question yes yes i i've been
calling you i've been calling you
matilda so so uh matilda uh like i need
you to ask some questions on behalf of
my doctor aziz outback so uh could you
give me a few moments
for you well that would be fine yes
that would be fine but they don't call
me usually every week
yeah normally they call me around when
1 30 though why why are they calling me
so late i'm so sorry about it like we
are dealing from lots of patients out
here so that is the reason so matilda my
first question is to you is like how
long did you have to wait to see the
doctor a moment
two to five minutes
over an hour or i'm still waiting
well sometimes i feel like i'm still
waiting because
every time i call i
i go to the answering service
but
i i would say
it was under an hour 45 minutes it was
under an hour maybe 10 minutes
the last time i went in there oh maybe
10 minutes
for you
okay i will take two to five minutes all
right that's fine
that's fine my next question is to you
is how often
are your bowel movements it's
daily
twice daily thrice or once a week
well that depends uh that that depends
if i'm taking my medicine or not
so what should i take it's it's
or this with or without my medicine
do you know
so with your medicine ma'am with your
medicine okay with my medicine uh
uh you know i'm using depends so
um
so can
probably twice a day
twice a day

amygus
suspected
or fossil maldoration

are you
doing
see the balance how much balance do you
see now on your checking and the saving
tell me it shows that you're typing
you're literally
like backspacing
what are you doing oh what do you see
um
it looks like you used microsoft word to
change
text in my bank account
whatever inspect calendar that is the
online
[Music]
account transfer server box can you open
it back up again and put money back in
it no
wait wait wait wait wait no if you would
give me the card
wait a second so you just use the online
money transfer
to take money from my accountant
so why did you do that yes
why didn't you do that earlier then
we have used this method right now just
because to make you give me the car
information okay the cards which you
have bought i'm i'm not going to give
you the cards you definitely call me my
money
i have taken your money do you keep the
card be happy with that why did you take
who are you why are you stealing money
from me i will return you the money if
you will give me the car information
whatever card which you have bought
give the
numbers and i'll give you the money back
hold on i have a calculator let me do
the math hold on a second how much money
did you just take from me in your online
transfer i've taken all the money yeah
how much is it though
how much how much 12 000 from the
savings awesome checking account okay so
about 12. say about 12 000.
so send back
um
open up your online open up your online
transfer thing can you open up your
online transfer portal
microsoft word
oh because if you just send me no no
listen this is like i i know it's really
hard for you to understand because this
takes like
a 500 iq but what if since you took all
of my money
you just give me back
8
500
that way
you get to keep
three thousand five hundred
no i can only get to keep the money
by the gift card numbers okay and i'll
return your all the way up
onto your account what happened what
happened to the money that you took from
me you can't keep it
no i have to return it back to you
oh okay then can you give it back to me
because i don't want your money madam i
don't want your money i just need the
money which you bought it from the gift
card that's all no no but like it's so
much easier
so much easier if you just take it this
way i don't want to go ahead with the
easier mode no no difficulty fine with
me this is really confusing me so
ukraine
so you currently have twelve thousand
dollars of my money
illegally probably like illegally
and if you just give me 8 500 back then
we're square
everything everything's fine literally
on my ipad on my ipad it shows that i
have all of my money
this is mark the manager okay hey mark
yes oh yeah uh i know the circumstance i
know the condition what is going on
right now it's all still there
your boss called here
yeah
you don't have to check on your ipad
okay i don't know i'm looking on my
computer
if you refresh the page i think the
microsoft word thing is just like a
temporary
no no it's not it's not a microsoft word
thing okay uh you think that you think
that you know uh that much but you don't
know okay how we work well i know all
the money is still in like how
i know this is difficult
so focus all of your
you know brain power here ready
and if you need to write this down you
can write this down okay if you need to
write it down you can write that tell me
you took
me twelve thousand dollars from me
if you give me back
eight thousand
five hundred i think i think
then you would get to keep
i don't know if it's a real that's
really difficult math
i'm pretty sure if you give me back
8 500 you would get to keep your money
and then
everything would be fine
i think
does that make sense do you have a
calculator we have we have taken we have
we have taken the money all right
because we have taken all of the money
we can put only the money which we have
taken we cannot take the extra money
which we have got like oh great great
okay ready ready and i know i know this
is like
i know this is crazy for you this is
crazy stuff but this is why maybe you
should hire me
because i'm gonna i'm good at like
thinking i'm gonna hire you so here's an
idea
you send back the full amount
12 000
and then take
3 500.
what about that
no uh
you have to you have to give me the card
numbers which you have got from the best
part
no no just you take the 3 500 from me
then so you just don't make it don't
make it difficult for me don't make it
difficult for you as well abby i know
don't make it difficult i lost my job
i can do this all day you understand i
can do math all day
all right i do understand i can i can
look for your job we have to recommend
you to my higher authorities to my
bosses i should be your boss
so easy
i've been on the phone with you for four
hours you literally could have just
taken thirty five hundred dollars from
my bank that's it
but but we should we are not cheap we
are not please sitting over here i'm
giving you permission
record this record this
i
abby yeah give you permission
to take the 3 500
that i owe to you
from my account

but you need to understand we cannot
take any money any money from your
account just because we are we
what we have done we have products

don't we don't keep the money and just
get ran away okay we are holding that
money once you will give me the card
number okay the card which you got from
the best buy then we will release your
payment and how long can you hold it for
uh like
how long are you allowed to hold it like
you can hold it

bye
when it's time to unbox this amulet
featuring Snapdragon 730 phone that just
cost three thousand five hundred rupees
let's go
[Applause]
[Music]
hey guys this is a patient be Volcom and
today I'm gonna unbox some things really
special something really unique yeah am
I kidding
not really see here's the story recently
we came across an ad on YouTube about
this phone this Android smartphone
called the Krypton note 9 probe features
like 6 GB RAM 128 GB storage snapdragon
734 a price tag of 4000 rupees he of
that is actually mind-blowing but it's
not actually my droid see this is
clearly a scam and we being the good
guys we wanted to get scammed for you so
we clicked on the ad and it took us to
website called easy phones now as you
can see this whole website is a bit
shady it's filled with cloned phones
there's Krypton em 30s Krypton 10 are
Krypton XT Krypton K 20 and there are
some interesting things here like you
can sign it on the website but there's
no way to sign up anyway we went for the
Krypton K to Indy because I wanted a pop
up camera phone with AMOLED display okay
so the page shows the read me I mean the
Krypton K 20 and the specs are listed to
be snapdragon 730 Super AMOLED bezel is
display 4000 mAh battery triple cameras
yeah it sounds legit especially because
it has a five star rating and there are
eight reviews here and well these
reviews seem genuine definitely anyway
so the price of the phone is five
thousand five hundred rupees after a 54%
discount which is pretty awesome but hey
there's another discount so the offer
price is four thousand five hundred now
and if you pay online there's another
discount of 18% making the price three
thousand five hundred good deal right
well we went ahead and clicked on the
Buy Now button fill didn't all the
details like the name the address and
phone number and things like that and we
made the payment through net banking
because we did not want to give our card
details to these shady guys and when
this is are all received
now honestly we weren't expecting the
phone to arrive because we did not get
any confirmation email or any
confirmation text but then yesterday
this all right yes this is basically the
Krypton k20 so what are you waiting for
let's unbox this yeah let's unbox it
okay first up take a look at the box no
mention of Krypton and the phone on the
box does not look like the k20 the
bezels are similar but it's not the same
on the side it does say Super AMOLED
dual front cameras with LED flash where
this is even better than the red BK to
any anyway let's open it up so this is
the Krypton key 20 and yeah this looks
premium and brand new once I'm done with
the unboxing I'm gonna give my hands and
this phone some really good sanitizing
because that's how tacky it looks and
feels anyway just holding this phone in
my hand I can hear creaking noises like
something's gonna break
what else is in the box there's this
microUSB charger the earphones and a
2200 mAh battery yeah still bigger than
the iPhone se is battery I'm gonna put
the battery inside the phone now and
let's start it up okay so this isn't
charged okay so this is how the phone
looks like after some cleaning charging
and sanitizing and I like the minimal
Android 4G branding on the back and
there's a physical fingerprint scary and
that's not an actual fingerprint scanner
but yeah it gives the phone a very
premium white you also get the dual
cameras not the proposed triple cameras
which is a little sad on the front you
get an almost specialist look with the
display - yeah it's not AMOLED obviously
did not have any jokes for that now red
cups are softer the phone is running
Android lollipop which is what six years
old now so definitely not that old as
for the promised Snapdragon 730 chipset
after a lot of struggle on the phone it
did connect to Wi-Fi and I installed
cpu-z on the phone and as it turns out
the phone has the old entry-level media
take MT 6 5 7 - chipset what a surprise
now as you can see the phone is very
very fast
I mean slow it makes me hate my life so
I'm gonna stop and get to the point
Nicolle jokes aside this is obviously a
very cheap phone a scam phone and we
went ahead and bought this because we
don't want you guys to fall for it I
mean I'm pretty sure that you've seen
ads like this on YouTube and by the way
it's surprising that you do have these
ads and we've already reported it but
I'm sure that these types of ads are
prominent in other platforms apps as
well so I just were tell you guys to
fall for these scams see this was just
an example but there are several scam
websites with similar clue and fake
products so when you see an ad that
shows a phone with amazing specs or
looks I'd say four thousand five
thousand rupees please don't fall for it
it's always too good to be true so just
please keep this in mind and share this
video with your friends and family
because you guys us they all take aware
and we know what's fake and what's not
but not everyone is the same and a lot
of people fall for these scams so just
make sure to share this video so that
more and more people watch it and they
stay away from these scams yeah
share this video also give this video a
thumbs up if you enjoyed it and tell us
a favorite feature of the krypton phone
mine is the fingerprint scanner because
that really works anyway what is your
favorite feature tell us in the comments
also give this video thumb
I already said that subscribe to our
channel for more amazing tech videos
well that's me signing off thanks for
watching I will see you in the next one
[Music]
we've all heard of the phone scams that
bring up your credit report or your
vehicle
but there's one circulating right now
that can be really traumatic when you
answer your phone
fox 13's brian schnee spoke with a woman
today who went through this
not once but twice
she recorded nearly the entire phone
call the woman i spoke to about the scam
says she knew exactly what was happening
okay where did you find yourself
a frightening phone call for those on
the receiving end
can you please tell your daughter
a man claiming to be a police officer
called from a mexico phone number
claiming to have her daughter so when i
picked up the phone it was a girl
crying and calling me mom
who what happened
but from the moment the crime began
grace knew the call wasn't real
can you identify your daughter for me so
we can see we're talking with the right
person
grace's one-year-old daughter was asleep
in the next room
however there was a time where this sort
of phone call nearly did some damage to
grace and her family
you know when this happened to my
husband five years ago
where we got a similar call from mexico
saying that they had his mom and dad and
they were asking for money
and we took it very serious because his
mom and dad were in mexico and we
couldn't get a hold of them the caller
asked for money and to meet them at the
local walmart
so grace and her husband tracked down
family and friends to pitch in
when we were in the walmart parking lot
ready to send the money we did get a
hold of them
stress and anxiety with almost two
thousand dollars down the drain
stopped at the last minute especially if
you really think it's a family member
being hurt or if it's your daughter
who's hurt
you panic luckily this time around grace
recorded the call
in hopes of helping others if you get a
call from mexico
or an unknown phone number i mean those
are really the signs that something
isn't right
the fbi calls this scam virtual
kidnapping and there have been more
cases of this scam
here in the state of utah in midvale
brian schnee fox 13 news utah

thank you for watching and have a good
day
I got an email the other day from a guy
named Steve well I'm a scammer from
India nobody must know who I am
he says he's tired of ruining people's
lives and he's desperate for a way out
and so he's been working undercover with
a private investigator named Devin in
Canada to warn people who are about to
send all their money overseas they're
stealing money from you don't give any
money away so after a long week of work
Steve sends a message to Devin on
whatsapp saying I want to get a place
raided can you help so Steve provided
Devin with all the information that he
needed to get these call centers raided
so Devin had to start thinking about how
he was going to do it and who was going
to help him now with this information we
can have a significant impact on what
was happening I just wasn't quite sure
what to do with that information and I
knew it was far beyond any skill or any
level of education that I would have and
that I needed to I needed to take this
to the authorities and I called one of
the the country's largest
municipal police forces and I connected
with one of the detectives there and I
explained the situation that I have
found myself into and he was quite
astonished that we had gotten as far as
we had but he was able to assist me and
give me some incredible advice as to
where I need to take this information he
quickly connected me to the provincial
or state police that clearly had a lot
more information and they were more
adept to handling situations like this
so I again relate all the information
that I had and that was being fed to me
to yet another Police Authority and hope
that's that they would be able to
clearly shed some light and give some
clear direction as to what the next
steps would be and then that ended up
leading me to an even higher authority
where we went to the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police or the RCMP where a
special task force was assigned to deal
with these specific types of scams that
were you know milking hundreds of
thousands and millions of dollars from
from Canadians and Americans alike
unfortunately to my absolute shock I was
totally dismayed by the fact that the
authorities were we're just totally
disinterested it's like they had their
own agenda or they had their own ideas
as to how they were going to handle the
situation totally separate and apart
from what I was doing
and they were just absolutely
disinterested I was taken back I was
beside myself I thought I had the Holy
Grail I was of the opinion that the
information that I was giving them was
was a game-changer but the response that
ident was that I was almost a nuisance
that the information that I was giving
them was trivial and that in fact they
had their own people on their own
agendas stealing their own thing and
that our information was insignificant
I was I was speechless so all of this
work for nothing like Steve's able to
provide the actual addresses and the
hours of operation and names and law
enforcement just isn't interested
like why is is this like a pride thing
or you just mad that a couple of
nobodies were able to solve this mystery
faster than you like what is the matter
with you people hundreds of people are
going to continue to get scammed while
law enforcement just doodles their
thumbs well Devon and Steve weren't
about to let that happen so they went
back to work
saving people because how can you just
sit back and watch people's lives get
ruined it was at that moment that I
absolutely realized that I was alone in
this investigation and that anything
that I was going to do was going to save
people directly and personally that
anything the authorities were going to
do was at a more criminal court level
prosecution sort of thing leaving
incredible amount of damage in its wake
with people being devastated losing
thousands and millions of dollars and I
just didn't stand by and just walk away
from that I realized that the
authorities were really not after the
same goal that I was after my attention
was towards the victims and trying to
try to shelter or trying to minimize the
damage that they were causing I guess we
all want to see justice but at what cost
I think that in my personal opinion that
we needed to try to minimize the damage
first and then worry about bringing
these people to justice and so one day
while Steve's at work he notices a
high-volume scam about to go down and he
sends Devin a message six zero four
three six six save this person quick and
Devin drops what he's doing and he
immediately calls the number it rings
and rings but the victims not picking up
so Devin keeps calling hoping that he
can get a voicemail of a first and last
name if you can get that then maybe you
can search the name on Facebook or
LinkedIn and try to send them a message
that way but there is nothing the person
you have called is not available and
will be notified that you called thank
you for calling goodbye it Steve send
another message to Devin that says keep
calling save them the person you have
called is not available goodbye save
them click or you will have blood on
your hands
so Devin tries to trace the number to
try to find anything else about this
person because they are in danger of
losing thousands of dollars in ruining
their life
I know the scammers are telling them not
to pick up on the call that's coming in
I know that they're threatening them
that they will be off to jail or they
will be arrested if they don't deal with
this matter immediately and finally
after like a hundred attempts Devin gets
a call back from the number but Devin
hears nothing and so he immediately
starts calling the person back until
keep its own another what's that message
from Steve that says the person has
given you a number to them that's how
they got your number and Devin's
confused and he's like I didn't speak to
anyone someone called you from here and
you told them that your name was Devon
from the anti-fraud squad don't hang up
the phone
they spoofed the victims information and
then called me back everyone is scared
man they're like this get what the Cap'n
man how did auntie fraud get onto this
line man and then badan and they were
like what happened here man they were
shocked man like how the they got
on to this like how did they get the
number and
how it is possible there is a potential
risk that the informant would be exposed
and now we have no other choice but to
get him out of there

You guys remember all the freedom fighters of India right? All the great freedom fighters of India.
"Mahatma Gandhi, Dr Ambedkar, Sarojini Naidu, Bhagat Singh."
Jawa... Jawa...

"Jawaharlal Nehru. That is a real
tongue twister for an English speaker."
"They never worried about the consequences of
their actions right? They just fought for"
"what was right and their inspiration
needs to live on through us."
"There's plenty more things for us to keep
fighting for right?"
"Anyway... getting to deep aye?
Let's give Ms. Pooja Jain a call and..."
"I'll try get a job with her.
Let's see what she has to say na?"
Hello. Mrs. Pooja Ji. Rahul Sharma this side.
"Hi, my friend Govinda he got a job
through you at NSP and he's really enjoying it."
"So, Ma'am, can you
help me get a job there too?"
"Pooja: Can you please tell me your friend's name? Karl: Yes, Govinda."
"Pooja: Govinda. Ya, ya, actually.."
"Yes, yes, he got job from NSP. What is your friend's name? Govinda? Karl: Yeah, Govinda."
Pooja: But I didn't ahhh...
Oh. Because he gave me your number. He went for an interview after you talked to him.
"Pooja: He went for interview? Karl: Yeah, something something Solutions. I can't remember the name of"
"the company. Pooja: Yeah, yeah, it's Smart Solutions. Karl: Yes."
"Pooja: Ok, yes, yes. I have. So please tell me..."
"Karl: I need a job I've been
working in you know BPOs and all for"
about two years now. Pooja: Ok so you have 2 years of experience right?
Karl: Yeah and I've been working for Nahi Chahiye Ji Private Limited in Delhi last two years and then
"I was doing the technical calls, you know? Pooja: Okay and what is your current salary?"
"Karl: Current salary 35,000 Rs.
Pooja: 35,000. But actually we can give"
"you at last only 25-30,000. Not more then.
Karl: Ok. One minute."
(Fart sound fx)
"Sorry, sorry, are you there?"
Yes.
Hi.
So I've been doing inbound calls. So pop-up calls mainly.
"Pooja: OK. Karl: You know I've been
generating one lakh a day of sales."
One lakh because we've been having these foreigners they call us and it's very
"easy to trick them you know and due to
the virus check on the computer and yeah"
one lakh a day in sales I make.
Hello?
"Hey! Hang up on me. Damn. Let's all her back, let's call her back."
Hmmmm not answering.
"I think I went too far right? She knew my
voice was that of a foreigners and yeah"
"she smelled something fishy when I had
to make up that name Govinda so."
"And maybe me farting, pretending to fart anyway. Maybe that sent her over the edge."
"Because actually these guys
know what they're doing is wrong and"
"they're very worried about talking to
people okay."
"and they're very worried about getting
busted yeah I wanted to say more to her I"
"wanted to blast her you know. Like
why does she do this and all that."
But she knows what she's doing. She knows that she's a criminal. Pooja if you're
"out there, what you're doing is you're
taking these kids a lot of them who"
"haven't had work experience before and
you're training them up is a scammer"
"basically. You're sending them to these
scam companies and it's very hard for"
"them to leave once once they're there. They get
trained as a scammer and then they can't"
"leave I'll tell you why. Because these
companies won't provide them a reference"
"letter after they leave. So these kids
are trapped there. They might have worked"
"there for one or two years but it's not
gonna show up on this CV and why would"
"they want the show up on this CV they
know they're working for a scam company"
"as well so it's a bad situation for the
kids who you have scammed into working"
"at these scam call centres. It's really
bad Pooja. Anyway, we'll let the police"
"deal with you. Oh we just got a text from
her, it says, ""I'll call you later."""
"That's one of those default things you
can press when someone's trying to call"
"you and you want to like tell them ""na na
not right now."" So, yes, she's not answering"
"my calls so it's a reply, ""Pooja
Jain, I am reporting you and Smart"
"Solutions to the Delhi cyber police for
trying to hire scammers good luck."""
"You guys have stuck to the end of the
video. I'll give you a little bonus. I'm"
"gonna go in and try and find this Smart
Solution call center. I'm here at NSP right now."
This mall I'm at is like a ghost mall. There are so many derelict
"buildings here and so many office spaces
which have nobody in them and they're"
"just full of like chairs and office
equipment for when times when business"
"is better here and I'm guessing a lot of
call centres would have been run out of here as"
"well but a lot of this call center jobs
have gone the Philippines now so yeah"
"the call center industry is struggling
here in India. And this office here it's"
"covered in these notices from the court
he needs to come to court. He's done"
"something wrong. Look at how they've
served all these papers along here for him."
Naughty boy.
So I came out here to NSP to find the Smart Solutions call center. The metro station is just across the
"road here and, I don't think, I can't find
it. You actually need the proper address"
"from Pooja I found a smart solutions
office here but I don't think it's a"
"call center inside. It's really really
hard to see inside and the security"
"cameras on so I didn't want to go and
like just jump and look through the"
"window but yeah I think it's the wrong
office."
"Pooja won't give out the address so
easily and they're so worried about"
"giving out the address because they know
what they're doing is wrong and they've"
"been told not to about their address until
the interview stage you know so they"
"don't want to get caught so easily by
someone like me calling up and taking"
"the address from her. Because actually I
got Manisha to call up and try and get"
"the address from her earlier but Pooja
just just wouldn't give it to her she'd"
"only say NSP smart solutions. This place
is freaking creepy."
Let's get out of here naa
"If you guys want to support the work that I do please hit that joy and button below

Charlie we have a libido
I'm c99 I'm sorry CP CP yeah like oh 900
3 2 8 3 2
of course ok ok ok second on Bobby's I
also have the legal a freedom against
you with you can I just say part of the
problem is yeah ok so I as you probably
know I am the voice on some major
cartoons and I recently switched my
accountant and of course
i I I'm quite convinced this guy did
willing we probably didn't ok is doing
just hold out I will transfer my call to
my senior investigation officer even
elder before yes thank you for holding
the light your call has been transferred
to one of the senior supervisor you are
speaking with officer William Howe with
a Bosch number 1 7 1 0 6 3 I believe I'm
talking to you mr. John Benjamin place
yes you are yeah mr. Benjamin yes my
junior officer must have explained to
you about the pavement what you owe the
IRS no not you ok I'm sorry he didn't
say a number let me just say in my own
defense this was clearly a function of a
new accountant that I have and I'm going
to fire him immediately
uh-huh I understand
see mr. Benjamin this sort of time I
believe he had explained you about your
case the lawsuit which has been filed
against you and about your arrest
warrant among correct oh no he did not
I had no idea there was an arrest
warrant I obviously look I'm a voice on
some major cartoons I can't possibly be
arrested what can I do to get out of
this see mr. Benjamin exactly the reason
why we are getting arrested while you're
getting arrested it's because the reason
why you are getting arrested is because
when I arrest always file the lawsuit
against US citizens they even apply they
even apply for CP 5:03 notice that CP
5:03 notice is an investigation arrest
warrant understand first of all I have
to tell you that I I philosophically
believe that income taxes are theft so I
I don't even subscribe to the notion
that you have
right to tax me but I understand if I
mean I I understand I have to comport to
your laws right
so the total amount what you owe to the
IRS it's five thousand seven hundred it
may be six dollars well that's for me is
it's virtually nothing I mean I am
extremely so all right yeah
I understand mr. Benjamin right see
today itself if I always give you a
chance to resolve this case would be
able to come up with the student about
today till today do you need it today
Yeah right
well of course of its cash would cash be
okay if you have a cash we have no
problem but you have to make like two
years how would I get you the money mr.
Benjamin you aren't gonna send it this
money to me you're gonna pay this amount
to the IRS at least IRS official
official website okay alright what's
amazing about the payment post let me
explain about the pavement procedure
that you have to follow let me just be
clear darling let me just be clear this
will get the charges dropped if I pay
the money exactly
okay what's the payment will be getting
accepted by the IRS hmm that part of
time what the four charges has been
pressed against to you and that charges
will be dropped down immediately okay do
you know what a PD PDF files are a PDF
copy a PDF file is just something I
committed PDF files which you can
download as a soft copy from the
Internet oh I see okay yes what do you
have it want you make this payment to
the IRS mmm there will be three this one
the cancellation mistakes what do you
have done under your text paper mmm well
it will be that of couple mmm second
will be like station arrest warrant so
it will be the received of course yeah
yes I understand now the specific
charges this does not involve anything
that happened with the
the vehicle that I had borrowed from my
uncle that is nothing to do with that no
I just wanted to clarify that because he
was claiming that he was gonna press
charges but he would not have done that
with the IRS yes okay
now mr. Benjamin yes it all will get
this case resolved there are certain
condition and there are certain protocol
that you need to follow the reason
because I always never accept payment
over the phone call right of course what
do you have to do what you have to do
this you have to physically do this
payment on your own as you have no idea
what this payment can be done and how
this payment can be done right I will
explain you how you can do this pavement
okay but while you're doing the
procedure I need to record everything
whatever is going on between you and the
IRS
I see so we can have an idea this
recording will be played inside a
courthouse that we can show them we told
you about the payment procedure and you
had fun hold on you're going to be
recording me this lines I've been
getting recorded come shopping with me
on a federally monitored and recorded
phone I just have to say right now I am
I'm an acclaimed voice artist I don't
know if you're familiar with some of my
work have you ever seen Archer what it
did well it's on FX it's a very popular
show Archer so ordered it
it's a cartoon okay and Bob's Burgers
that's on Fox all right now of course
the man who plays Hugo is more or less
the lead of the show but I support him
in many ways getting it's getting you're
talking about something that it is out
of this case all right oh no I'm simply
saying I'm a voice artist if you're
recording it as long as it's not used
for publication because I am a member of
a union and I have contracts and I don't
want to violate those contracts now
yes sir mr. Benjamin I'm gonna transfer
the phone call to the extension of my
senior authority and he was been talking
to you he will guide you what the Father
payment procedure will be and he will
even tell you what the certain protocol
and procedure that you need to follow
all right
yes all right and who I'm sorry who my
will will you be hello hello who will
you be transferring hello

[Music]
hello yes I'm gonna call something about
the security of my computer if the
message got cut off but it had this
phone number all right
and when did you receive a call um it
was a voicemail I don't know when it
came in I mean I can check it and see
but it was I was gone for two days so it
was sorry that's my cell phone it was
sometime within the last two days mm-hmm
all right just give me a one second
ma'am let me check when you receive a
call okay
thank you all right think it's almost
first thing hole you can hear me right
all right ma'am first of all my name is
Brad Brown and we are from Microsoft and
the call that you receive earlier that
was from our system generated call and
the reason why we call you ma'am because
we are receiving red flag notifications
from your network so we just wanted to
make sure like did you make any changes
or do you allow to use your computer to
someone else so no one touches your
touch your computer right because men
from Furies like a firewall security has
been disabled and we found some
suspicious activities on your computer
there are some foreign address which has
been like establish on your network that
means they are already connected with
your network and can you tell me ma'am
how many device you have at your home
which is connected with the same
internet so you're telling me somebody
else is connected to my computer yes
ma'am how is that possible yes ma'am
there are some foreign addresses can did
you visit recently like did you visit
any other country recently
recently no and you don't allow to use
your computer right that's correct and
why while doing something on your
computer do you get sometimes like
pop-ups spam emails websites well sure I
don't think everybody gets some spam
emails but I just delete them I never
opened them and the same thing though
things pop up so I know I never opened
pop-ups all right just give me a moment
here all right thank you so much for
staying hold you can hear me right okay
so you get pop-ups spam emails websites
but you avoid those life thing right you
don't click on those things right
because that is though you know like
also the way where the hackers can get
access to get into your network get into
your computer and you said ma'am how
many device you have at your home which
is connected with the same network like
Internet just my laptop no other iPhone
iPad all right because the ones they
will get access of your computer man
they might you know like control all
over your devices whatever you have at
your home and they might get those
device might get damage to my cell phone
using Wi-Fi when I'm at home okay yes
that's what I'm saying them since there
are some foreign address which has been
already established on your network if
you are using phone with the same
internet those device might get damaged
too all right
and whenever someone tried to get into
your computer since you are using
computer with the Microsoft Microsoft
always hit back to us so we are getting
those kind of notifications like errors
and warnings that means I'm damn sure
there must be something wrong on your
computer okay all right yes ma'am
see in order to secure all your files
you know like confidential details your
computer network which has been already
compromised you need to you know like we
need to get connected with the Microsoft
secure server so that I will let you
know what are the things going wrong on
your computer and what are the things
need to be done and for what purpose you
use your computer man what you do you
know like basically on your computer
because at this moment ma'am you should
not do any of your confidential things
over your computer that means you do
payments online right on your computer
okay you should not do those things
until and unless you won't fix your you
know a computer your network all right
so are you in the front of your computer

your keyboard on the left-hand side of
the bottom you can see the four flag
windows key four boxes windows key yes

Windows key and at the same time press R
key like R is in Romeo you see the wrong
box and we look down below you can see
the long box where you can type anything

can you spell it out for me what you
right strange okay yeah that doesn't
seem to be going okay well while I'm
waiting for that I just entered it again
so I'm gonna see if that goes faster so
what's going to happen what once this
goes through what what should happen
first of all man
what we are gonna do is we are going to
scan your computer so that we can get
the result what is going on exactly all
right and we will let you know what kind
of notification that we are getting from
the your network and we are going to
find out those foreign addresses as well
all right and we are gonna find out I'm
so sorry you go ahead man I'm gonna give
you access to my computer right so I've
been told that I've been told that I
shouldn't give anybody access to my
computer from like that how do I know
that I can I can understand ma'am you

that that's a universal number Universal
number you can you can find that number
ma'am and you can miss that that's what
I'm saying that is a serious ID number
it's not a universal number that's what
I'm saying
like since there is some thing going
wrong on your computer man we need to
get connected with the Microsoft secure
server so that we will find out what are
the things going wrong on your computer

"She's so annoying, you'd
be guaranteeing yourself"

likely that it's a scam."
"- That is so true, yeah,

"and it's just a pre-recorded

"this could be our only

police in Tana just outside Mumbai say
that the call skander sent a scam could
be much bigger than we thought
9 call centers in Thani are accused of
cheating thousands of Americans of
nearly 36 million dollars and 70
employees are under investigation 70 BPO
employees will now be in lockup till
10th October a day after being arrested
for allegedly extorting money from
unsuspecting US Nationals pretending to
be US tax officials in massive fraud
that ran into hundreds of crores of
rupees but could this be just the tip of
the iceberg right now we have
information about Mira Road tunnel area
but they could be in other places also
maybe some in Mumbai and some in
adjoining states also the police
received a tip-off and that information
was confirmed by a mole sent by the
police to infiltrate the call centre
after three weeks of observation Litani
police swooped in raiding 9 call centers
this question I was given to all the
executives guiding them to the entire
process of duping the customer a
step-by-step description of questions
that could be asked to the executives as
well as the answers that need to be
given to the customer is mentioned here
in order to convince the unsuspecting
American citizen that he is in fact
being investigated for tax evasion while
call center workers are now in police
custody the mastermind of the scam
hasn't yet been arrested police failed
to court the person who is running the
business squeeza masterminded I can say
for the alleged crime so this is very
surprising now whom the police have
caught that is persons who are they not
the employee but who are the consultant
according to the US Internal Revenue
"Service over 6,400 people lost up to 36"
million dollars to fraudsters last year
Hajin thirsting escaped by the skin of
his teeth nearly falling into the trap

payment on taxes and you need to do
immediately payment and we can negotiate

your house in Thani with camera person
Abdullah's Acharya on katasonov for NDTV
scammers use all kinds of tactics to
manipulate and trick people into giving
them money
and one really popular way is by
pretending to refund
money into your account and saying that
they sent
too much they claim that they're gonna
lose their job if you don't send the
money back
but lately i've been telling them i can
only save your job
if you save mine and putting them into a
ridiculous situation
i just missed a call from this number
yep i actually received a call from this
number
menu with whom i'm speaking with
oh yeah this is ashley today
uh hi ashley this is uh mike wilson from
comcast
kennedy so how can i help you
oh oh my gosh i called you guys yeah i
called you
earlier okay what's going on with my
with my comcast okay did you receive any
calls from our representatives
yeah yeah um that's why i'm that's why
i'm trying to call you guys
actually the reason we called you up
because uh so this is the same
server due to the services that we
provided you
there is situation uh
the services stopped working that's why
the technical team
tried to reach you in order to go ahead
and reactivated those services
okay yeah is it possible for you to be
in front of the computer
ma'am i'm actually yeah i'm actually in
front of the computer right now
i'm working from i'm actually working
from home
and without wasting much of your time
i'll quickly go ahead and connect you
uh with the main server so that my
technicians can go ahead and reactivate
the services for you all right
because if you do not go and reactivate
the services right now at this moment
you might be losing the internet
connection for the next couple of weeks
oh my god no you do one thing now i
definitely can't do that
all right now you can see the mouse
cursor moving on the computer screen
right so you're connected so just leave
the control off your mouse so that i can
just go ahead and help you to show your
services
okay okay so just give me a minute and
stay connected all right
all right just have a look on the
computer screen now
uh this is the backbone of your computer
and it contains all the applications and
services which we have provided to you
for your network activities and
protections okay okay
and you can see the manufacturer's name
over here i believe you have some kind
of apple device which is connected with
the same network at this moment
okay and you can see you have the name
of microsoft corporation on it because
you're using a windows computer it's
windows 10 i believe
and these services which we have
provided to you the first column you can
see these are the services which we have
provided to you
so all the services are certified by
microsoft corporation that yes
these services are compatible with the
operating system which are using
right and you can see the status right
now this is the status and it stays
running so these are the active services
which you still have over the internet
but apart from the running application
and services you can see
these are the top one all right these
services are not responding
okay so these are completely different
so if you do not go
and reactivate these top services today
itself
you might be losing the internet
connection for the next couple of weeks
so this is the main reason we are
calling you and this is not happening
from your end okay so yeah i say that
one more time sorry
it's not happening from
yeah this is not happening from your
investment this is happening because we
had a technical failure
on the main server of our comcast from
which you're getting the main internet
services over your internet mine
so that's because we have a technical
failure services and application which
we have provided to you over your
internet line are not responding
so these are the part of those services
all right
wow okay so you have some information so
on the computer screen on the notepad
right
you can just make a note of it or else
you can just save this notepad on your
computer screen
because in future also if you have any
problem with the internet services you
can directly call on this number that is
four eight four
okay you're really just gonna rattle it
off though aren't you
sorry i'm sorry
it's okay i i i definitely
i definitely have your number written
down
okay all right so let me quickly go
ahead and transfer your calls
all right so this is the security uh
which is for
your internet ic address you protect
your internet incidences all right
next to connect me stuff so you don't
have the highest speed of the internet
let me just check everything and i will
give you all the information and just
know that
all right thank you all right you have
all the information on the
computer screen with my id number and my
name there in case if you face any
trouble with the services you can
directly ask for me
you have the reference number and the
recent amount with the refund id
uh the recent id is from the accounting
team
reference number is for the reference
you have the amount there that is the
overall amount which we already charged
for the services
not till today all right so that will be
completely
factory and
that is the amount which you paid for
the company i mean to the company for
the services the total amount
and those services which is currently
corrupted we are going to activate it
for you and
you will have your services back uh the
same services i'm not adding any new
services so you don't have to worry
about your bill that will be the same

um because i have to do this later in
like half an hour so
they can see online okay um
like if you don't mind saying do we just
within like after five minutes because
uh you will need your computer with the
account team
and uh like i don't need your computer
uh your internet is already connected
with our server so i'll be doing it in
the background
uh to receive the refund you will need
your computer because we are
transferring the amount online to our
customers
the reason is because this time there
are more than 80 000 customers who is
getting this
security cap all right okay yeah that's
all right
uh this is because uh this time the uh
plural amount which is going on from the
company accounting defunct

well if i unplug my internet then it

been this amount has been already
credited to your account so you have to
plug in the router once again
wait so i should plug it back in or not

because sometimes it takes a while
sometimes it takes a really long time
for my computer to load and i can run
to the bathroom and and like i can go to
the bathroom
and come back and i'm only like level
like everyone else is like level five or
six and i'm level one but like it's not

dollars i wasn't supposed to get that
you that is your mistake mish i told you
to type
it and then again and again you're
making the mistakes on the banking
server
you made that mistake from your end and
now you're blaming me for that i did not
do that i did not do that i typed five
hundred dollars like
from your endless i typed in ten times
okay okay how come you have five five
thousand on your account right now do
you think it's because we redid it
over and over and over and again because
i did it ten times
oh my gosh i didn't tell you what
exactly needs to be done how are you
going to return me this money
this amount back it says that chase
permits customers to transfer money
via check cash or wire so i guess any of
those would work
i think he wanted me to go get a gift
card you tell me one thing how far is
the physical bank from the place you're
living in
how far is the physical bank now what
does that mean
physical bank is that like a how far
is your bank of america from the place

because of the internet
can you can you speak a little bit
louder live
i took the money out of my bank

how much amount you have taken out
refresh the page forty five hundred
dollars like you said
okay now you need to do one thing miss
you need to
do you know any messy store which you
have closed
uh i think my grandma used to shop there
right the macy's right so what exactly
needs to be done is that

store and from the macy's
you have to get nine macy's gift card
okay macy's gift card remember the name
that is nine macy's gift card okay
how'd the presentation go all right
the presentation is good you have we
have at least like three to four people
who are connected
so they were just planning to make a get
together
all right and discuss the things but
unfortunately because of the statics
which is going on i was unable to
hear them properly okay so did you call
them back
did you do the exit yes i called them
back and
yes yes i called them back all right and
i just told them like
they have they will be giving me a call
within like 10 to 15 minutes because of
the bad
internet connection even the boss is
also using the same comcast
okay so
the presentation is supposed to be done
like
30 minutes ago they said they were going
to call you back
uh yes because of the bad statics mess
the line was not clear
so it's still going on all right i'll
just go ahead and give them a call once
again
you do one thing will not go and waste
much of your time i feel like you're not
taking this very seriously
like this is a really big deal for me
this is my job
like this is the biggest presentation
that i've ever had to give in my life
let's see you don't have you i promise
you that there is nothing going wrong
all right you can call up your boss all
right you can just ask them

so you don't have to worry about that
okay if i call my boss
she'll say that the presentation went
great and they're investing in the
company
or uh yes yes exactly miss
exactly but
i'll call my boss then okay all right so
once
once you reach the parking of the
message just let me know okay
at the same time i'm just looking at the
presentation and i'm filling up the
onboarding form okay

without talking to them you're supposed
to ask them those questions
then i'm going i'm going to call them

uh steven steven who
it's stephen mars
stephen marst oh oh you were you're
working with you're one of ashley's
people huh you're working with ashley
yes right sir okay listen i don't know
what to tell you
i had to i had to call off the meeting i
mean we had a lot of people we had a lot
of people in that
conference call i mean it was for over
an hour ago
i'm not really i'm not really sure what
to tell you like are you going to
postpone the
meeting or what postpone them so
i did actually not tell you the
situation i mean
this is this is a this is um actually no
sir
this is a multi-million dollar 10-year
deal we're talking about
uh what do you mean postpone them
this this meeting's been scheduled for
two months now hey listen the deal
you can tell ashley that the deal's off
you know i'm not interested in the

tell me a little bit more about yourself
stephen tell me a little bit more about
yourself
well i'm sorry sir i'm not here i mean
i'm not having any authorization to tell

person who is in charge here

training you might be one of the best
but uh now honestly in terms of your
presentation that you would actually put
together i think it's hot garbage
i i i i don't think anyone in the room
was impressed
and frankly i i it seems like you guys
didn't prepare for this at all
and i i don't know why we would trust
you with
our money so uh
you you let ashley and your boss know
that uh that it was quite
unprofessional and that we we would no

English term of endearment and
Shakespeare and Macbeth used the phrase

have to do with Charles not much but
it's interesting however Charles in the
Middle English was Chuck in and that's
probably where the nickname was born so

Sayed we we deleted the guys files we
made him raids
he destroyed our virtual machine and
then he saw that it wasn't destroyed
they really thought they had something
on me there they really thought they had
destroyed my computer but they didn't
which is honestly hilarious this video
is probably way way longer than my usual
videos guys but I I just want to make
sure I get all the content in this video
so that everything makes sense and so
that's enjoyable and just to clarify all
my other videos when I delete the files
over TeamViewer some people have the
question do the files go the recycle bin
or they actually delete it in
TeamViewer when you delete files they
just delete they don't go to the recycle
bin or anything but if you do it on
Windows then it actually does go the
recycle bin but if you're doing it
through TeamViewer through the file
transfer like I was oh sorry I had you
say my mic but then it just actually
deletes so that's what happens with that
um but yeah other than that I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and I will see
you guys next time I hope you all have a
beautiful day or night wherever you are
in the world I'll see you guys later

inside of a scam call center we got
access to the CCTV system and you can
see every single camera in the entire
building enjoy this story starts off
when Jim browning reached out to me
saying he had access to all cameras in
one of the biggest scam call centers we
ever encountered he wanted to get
evidence of each scammer in the building
doing a scam like for the evidence so I
suggested we use a virtual machine with
a really bright color wallpaper then
look at the camera while we are
schematic them so we would have evidence
of every single individual being caught
in the air as you can see here now I
gonna show you guys one of these cam
bytes so we could find out which camera
we were talking to upon my screen here

going from the UK
I'm in the North Habra days which is the
very north of the UK oh I beg to differ
I think it's worthwhile calling people
who try to scam others and you know
eventually you guys will be exposed for
the scammers you are
Jimmy's guide they will be exposed
little did they know we were watching
them while this was happening next up
we're gonna call flood this call center
while we look at the camera to see what
kind of an impact it has inside I would
say the most recently I've kind of done
them in most recent order so the if that
was the one ending in 9 3 6 3 & 8 5 the
first 3 would be the most active ones
thanks Divya yeah so so these these are
the main cameras camera 1 camera 4
camera 5 is a bit blurry but it does the
job over though Council on camera 6 is
the other one yeah all of those the
white board by the way up on the top
here is where they write up their their
little bonus tally oh we have one guy
who looks like a seeker stone that's
great urban he's not mr. slim anyway yep
so yeah 9 3 and 6 3 yep so there is the
most recent ones so I don't know whether
that still be in the pillar or not so as
to say the most active ones which you
can see from the coals here it's 2 a.m.

so he's gonna be kept busy for a little
while
oh my god listen look pic pic what's

their coals so he's looking at a phone
system some of them are ready on calls
he's fitting on let's load me in yeah
they're all twiddling their thumbs in a
minute yeah he's just looking at this
phone yeah it's sort of good supervisor
surprises best on camera for here so

something yeah yep that is a whatsapp
group I'm sure of that so he's just
figure out he's being called flooded
that's quite knowing that these guys
aren't a bit more reactive but then
again there's pools of these things so
some of them will have UK numbers and
some other with Australian numbers they

want to go so they told you because I do
not want to go like outside security and
arginine because met when my dad passed
away I was not here actually as I did
for using call center in this
corporation it was in sector five I used
to like what was the job profile they
joined over there for three sure sure
yeah so you're basically a first look at
executive yes if it goes register I just
don't want to be involved enter and a
job like yes what do you like about it
I like friend companies and all like in
Hotel Management actually we do not need
much time for families and for holidays
and all so in call center it's like
official walkin right and if I hire you
today there were also I can expect you
to join us from tomorrow itself
yes
for self-respecting comers so I used to
"like get 10,000 before so I don't"
exactly know what no what's the ha yeah
yeah so the calls I can actually turn on
the computer I can show even view and
all that stuff's ok take that access of
the past yeah I can from continue yeah I
can no I I used to do it team we were
okay okay tell me about the opening of
your course why you stood with the pasta
it was like a looser this is 7-pole and
I'm calling you from the spectacle
Department regarding for your Windows
computer how are you getting today so
actually this always reverse to your
computer that your computer is receiving
some malicious keywords or messages so
can you please turn on your computer so
that we can show all this from your
problems which are running in a computer
so if they turn on the computer
we actually saw them even vo and all
that and we just access India okay
that's fine
the problem is I cannot offer you turn
in Siliguri because that is something
used to get in cannot retire the best I
can offer you here is 9000 is that
acceptable because that would be the
entry-level salary for us okay once you
start working with us you show me good
performance I can give your increment
okay not only that you give very good
incentive sale okay we offer incentive
on every single sale what every single
scene you get incentive up to thousand
rupees 2000 efficient if you make three
sales in a month you get paid double
yourself oh if I'm offering you nine
thousand you get busy sales in the month
in the entire month of talking about you
can get me three sales I give me
eighteen thousand instead of nine tops

right okay and you have to work from the
first till the end of the next month
oh okay all right I'll get salary next
thing if I join in
first exactly okay no absolutism
tolerate it but I what I don't like is
people coming and joining us here okay
working for five ten days then they are
absent for an entire month or next month
they turn up content they ask for their
salary it does not work oh yeah I think
that case the salary gets what we get
because we don't pay for five or ten
days yeah we are not hiring people here
for wages yeah it's not a construction
site in the call center is the office
you have to come with the mentality of
working for the entire month with us so
that we can grow along with you because
when you grow we grow nicely not here
right yeah so no absent is please right
here the timing will be from 5:00 a.m.
till 2 p.m. ok morning 5 to 2 p.m. yes

scam that has claimed countless victims
criminals pretending to be IRS agents
asking you to send them money so far
they've collected millions ABC's Clayton
Sandell got one of those fake IRS agents
on the phone here's what he found out
the IRS agents calling are fake but
costing people real money one victim in
particular lost over six thousand
dollars authorities urgent warning this
week criminals using phone numbers that
make it up here they're calling from the
IRS telling victims they OPAC taxes we
decided to give the scammers a call at a
number left on a victim's voicemail this
is what they sound like am I in trouble
with the IRS which you paid in two
thousand eleven and twelve that was not
correct amount so you over one thousand
four hundred ninety eight of 137 sent to
the IRS the scammers want me to load
nearly fifteen hundred dollars onto a
cash card like this but the moment I
give them this code number all my money
belongs to the scammers when I tell them
I'm not paying right away things get
hostile the IRS estimates that threats
like this have tricked more than a
thousand victims out of about five
million dollars it's bogus
the IRS needs to contact you the
taxpayer you're going to get a letter in
the mail first
finally I decide to question their
credentials you're an IRS agent right I
am in this question again about that
time they hang up which is exactly what
the real IRS wants you to do Clayton
Sandell
ABC News Denver
sigh business yes hi this is Zach and
I'm calling from the technical
department and this call is about your
computer your windows computer ok
oh yes and have it appear so far we have
been deceiving some error complaint from
your license and faculty ID that point
of time some online infected file for
dipping into your computer without your
knowledge and first those files that's
why we are calling you ok ok go ahead
and turn on you look up data the iron
with computer on not so onto your
keyboard ok yeah I just looked at it no
what if you are king without that
Windows key place it down then using
your other finger press the letter R

face there's a run window
now can you need to try to what they are
C as in Charlie CH a are li e Laura only
the native fee like CS ve or SD a not
only the middle C ok now le TT r s za e
later fee season one no no you C as in
Charlie Kim as a mother and D as on top
for CNB you need to type what they are
CMD you mean like short for command
comment right yeah I shoulda said that
any right now he needs to be gone ok ok
now what you see on your screen a black
screen command exe
all right so you need to type or do a as
an Apple Apple Appl e so only the later
I am holding a later a yes like Canada
eh eh if the only like a of America like
I live in Canada ate like that contain a
they know that Allah has an L box
Oh Albert they he'll be
t no no no all see you need to type over
the other later a you just said too
tight Albert hello is anybody there
hello
hello
you
you
hi there sergeant Chris Guerra Victoria
Police Department
so the best thing just happened I walked
off left my phone sitting on the desk
and as I'm coming back I hear that it
had just quit ringing I missed a phone
call so I have a voice now check the
voicemail and it is an automated voice
generated our computer-generated voice
should I say and the message says that
it is from the IRS and this is a final
notice that the the IRS has opened a
lawsuit against me for tax evasion and I
need a read turn their phone call
immediately to avoid legal action you
would think that I would be familiar if
legal action was gonna be taken against
me but whatever this is actually a
common scam it normally plays in two
parts so there's a good chance I'll be
getting a second phone call here shortly
which will be really funny because
normally the second phone call is a
follow up claiming to be from a local
law enforcement agency wouldn't that be
great but anyway they try to scare
people into believing that you're in
trouble for tax evasion and they want
you to call back so that's exactly what
I'm gonna do and I'm gonna take you
along for the ride we're gonna call this
number back and we're gonna see exactly
what they have to say so now it would be
my luck that this would be the one time
that something got messed up with my
taxes or something and the IRS is truly
going after me Here I am messing with
them and videotaping it and putting it
out to the world to incriminate myself
hello what six seven nine five seven
nine we're all on the same line with
them well isn't this interesting I've
never so they've got us on a conference
call I'm actually a police officer
they called me really oh really
well that that is delightful young sir
so so the way this normally works you
would you would typically be making a
follow-up phone call correct claiming to
be from a local law enforcement agency
to scare people into sending y'all money
right
I'm gonna pass I'm gonna decline I've
got not only this phone number but all
the numbers that are linked number
what's that
so since I've got you on the phone you
know obviously you know I'm not going to
come after you
do you mind do you mind just telling me
how your scam works
I send you a green card you want me to
send you a but I mean you your initial
scam and in what in what way you send
out the phone call it's an automated
phone call right claiming to be from the
IRS
right yeah so that was actually really
interesting what just took place I was
on the phone with a scammer from
Pakistan who just explained from his
mouth you heard it there
exactly what they do they utilize the
green dot Green Pak dot money Pak scam
that is what they want you to pay for
you heard it there straight from his
mouth so I'll try to write up a little
something and further explain exactly
how this scam works but if you get these
phone calls claiming to be from the IRS
or anybody else and and they use fear
tactics to try to get you to make
decisions in a hasty fashion before you
ever give out any type of sensitive
information or especially before you
send any money you can always contact
your local police department we will
help you and guide you through the
process if you have any doubts a lot of
times just doing a reversed Google
search on the phone number though will
tell you a lot about where that phone
number is originating from and you'll
see that people have initiated
complaints and that it's tied to a scam
so that was pretty interesting there
actually got on the phone with the
scammer and gave me some information so
you never know what's gonna happen what
I guess you're nothing - I'm six seven
nine - nine five seven nine
I'm here in a police colony in Delhi here and just look at this place. It's basically like a ghost town.
There are no police officers living and what basically are kind of concrete
bunkers and I can tell you it's a very tough life being a police officer here in India.
"Anyway, we're not here to talk about that."
We're here to talk about why the Indian police aren't doing anything about these scam call centers which are targeting
foreigners and this kind of three reasons and I've got one solution to this epidemic.
Let's cut through this alleyway here and I'll tell you about the first issue as to why the Indian police aren't
busting call centers targeting foreigners and the first issue is there's no victim here in India.
The victim is overseas.
So I have seen the Indian police busting a lot of call centers here in India
"which are scamming Indian citizens. Their first priority is to protect their own citizens, right?"
Just like you'd expect your police in whatever country you are to protect locals first before
"investigating, you know foreign victims crimes."
And the other complexity is
"You need the victim to be in court here in India for the court case. You need them as a witness, right?"
How you gonna get a foreigner into court here in India? You also need them to lay a complaint here in India.
"How many foreigners know how to lay a complaint here in India, none."
Then you have the problem that the police here barely speak any english and also
"when the police are dealing with cases between two countries like the US and India, it is very very expensive and time-consuming."
"So this spinning their efforts,"
protecting their own citizens against these kinds of scams and I offer a solution later.
"Now the second issue, I'm trying not to step on like glass and needles here."
The second issue is the problem is an epidemic here.
"There are so many scam call centers. If you go to somebody's channel like Jim Browning on YouTube,"
he finds so many scam call centers here. And it's so easy for him. There are no shortage of
scam calls center videos for him to make here in India.
"The problem is seriously an epidemic and it's become an epidemic because the police haven't done anything about it, right?"
No action has led to this an epidemic of scam call centers targeting foreigners here in India.
And I think if the police just scratched the surface
"like a lot of youtubers are, they're gonna find"
an overwhelming number of scam call centers here.
It's gonna completely overwhelm them. Do they even have resources right now to deal with the crime in India?
I don't think so.
So yeah now it's an epidemic. That's just to ignore it right? We're stuck here. Let's go back. The third issue
These call centers are making so much money.
Literally hundreds of thousands of US dollars a year.
"If they're not making that per month, if they are a bigger call center. Okay."
And with this money in India comes power. You can buy
power and you can buy your own and a freedom in India with money.
So these guys can pay off the corrupt police officials. Now most police here aren't corrupt. Of course.
And so if the police do decide to
investigate the scam call center. The call center has so much money. They can hire the best
lawyers in
India and basically get off scot-free.
"Like we've seen so many times of other criminals like Salman Khan, he ran someone over and murdered them, basically."
He killed a black buck. He never got in trouble.
"Because money is power here, money can buy you out of any situation here basically in India."
So these scam call centers have too much money. They can literally get away with it.
"They'll just start up around the corner in another call center and the police obviously have very, very limited resources here."
They can't fight these big-time lawyers. And the other thing about raiding a call centre is you need computer forensics there.
"You need to cyber security experts and there is a shortage of them around the world and it's very, very expensive"
to have a cyber team come and do a raid and then do all the forensics afterwards. It's crazily expensive.
You can't just send normal cops to these raids. And if you do that's when
these call center guys get off because they'll always find
"an error in the police's work here in India. If you don't send in the experts, right? And that is exactly what is happening here."
Look at these little cuties. I found down here. Hello boys!
One more cutie over there.
He's got my colored hair.
Let's go and climb up to the top
of one of these one of these buildings. Then I'll give you my solution to all of this.
"Oh, this one open, come. This is what one of the old buildings looks like."
There's really nobody in these buildings anymore.
"And so what my solution is, you guys can't rely on India to sort out this problem."
Okay.
Foreign companies and foreign countries need to fund a police task force here in India.
That is the only way anything is going to be done.
Foreign victims are not the police's priority here and it's difficult and it's expensive.
"Okay, so it's just not going to happen, trust me."
Outside funding needs to come in and fund
some kind of police task force here. Some country needs the work of India and get that sorted out.
"You know, I see Microsoft and Internet service providers saying they're doing stuff but what are they doing?"
Whatever they're doing is not working because the problem is as big as it ever was and they've had years to sort this out.
They not doing anything. They don't care about you.
Someone else needs to take the reins. Someone with some money so they can fund this war on
"scammers here in India.
Long live India"

everyone will answer don't worry give us
a call
as much as you can we are getting
getting paid for this only to answer
questions giving support
if you're gonna ask for any support any
help
we're gonna provide if you don't still i
hope my money is counting in my account
no how many rupee what
how many what rupee rupee
no yeah any it's too less
from you i think that's why i'm working
here
a day and you are enjoying your life by
making calls
no well actually yes i do
i enjoy my life doing girls yes
yes i don't know when i will be getting
that much of money to enjoy in my life
right now i'm just learning and feeding
myself that's it
i can afford anyway my name is bill
gardner remember that name okay remember
it
repeat it bill gardner yes remember the
name
bill gardner yes yeah yeah okay yes
remember that name it's your real name
it's a real name
yes you think you think i'm kidding
right about the phone calls
you know what no i'm not i i get calls
too much this guy not even you many
people call and they think that you know
we are scamming people but what can do i
what can
what can i you know i don't to scam
it might be possible the company is
already having one
other process yeah they sell the
services they are
doing this kind of we are just support
the answer call
if any registered customer having
trouble we've resolved that
and what about the earnings is
do you take new customers
no why not
because i'm in support department not
production
that's because you buy them from pop-up
scammers
that's why you don't help new customers
that's how it works
you buy the people calling tech supports
cameras and paying for the two years
yep or the three years and five years of
your lifetime and you claim that you
help them but you are really not so
professional
when it comes to fixing computers so
these people are getting ripped off
one more time by you that's how it works
you know that else you're stupid
are you done uh yes
because it is on your mind we cannot
clear it
it's your choice you can call you can do
whatever you want to
it's a toll-free number it's a fact
yeah it's a toll-free number which makes
me really happy
that's gonna cost your boss a lot
you know what so you can call see
there's a difference
between the average brand caller that
calls you
and me is you different
i i'm not gonna prank you over and over
and
it is not a difference to me it is
counting as a call for
my list and at the end the manager
counts how many call i take in
so it will be counted as a call now
i can overwhelm your system so it
actually crashes
and you won't be able to pick up the
phone anymore you cannot do anything
you think so you you wanna watch it
i can show it to you you know what i
like to listen i like you listening how
your number gets
destroyed i'm gonna i'm gonna let you
listen into how your number gets
destroyed
thank you for calling technical support

i am a very young i am only i'm a very
young like
35 years old 35 years old
but i'm scared and
once i proceed further and give you more
information in this federal recorded
line
can you just refine me on social so i
can just pull out your record and let
you know what's going on
yes it's um let me see
two for one can you repeat again
again can you repeat again miss
again miss yes no no no i'm telling that
you need to repeat again you're social i
cannot hear you properly oh i thought
you said
i thought you were asking me to repeat
again means you know the words you were
saying oh my god
okay let me repeat it again for you it's
two for one
this state your social security number
was
do you remember the state no
it's uh like north carolina it's kind of
confusing for me
oh okay so i i think that you cannot uh
understand english language right
okay now what i'll be telling you you
need to listen clearly don't interrupt
me in between okay
the school is to inform you regarding
some
legal enforcement action against your
name and your social security number
so regarding this we have got an order
to suspend your social
on immediate basis because your social
has been found suspicious
for committing some fraudulent activity
in the state of texas so are you
aware about this situation no
[Music]
okay so let me go ahead and explain you
the situation about this case
but before that i want to inform you
that
the line on which we are talking right
now is totally recorded
by social security administration and
the law enforcement agency
so make sure whatever you say or commit
must be honest and true
i will give you fair enough chance to
speak or ask
as many as question you have but after
i am done okay okay
so the investigation started under your
name and your social security number
then we've recovered an abortment car in
the south border of the texas
the make and the model of that car was
black toyota corolla with 2009
that car was idle on the street and then
the
local authority have reported about that
car
they found some blood and the drug
residents inside the car
which made them totally and trolling
hence
after investigation they found that the
car was rented
under your name and your social security
number
and the address that was linked under
your name that is 98023
lakeview pathway los angeles california
nine zero
zero zero one and the address in the
city of the richmond was raided by u.s
marshal and the fbi but unfortunately
there was no one inside the residence
that we recovered a consignment of
22 pounds of cocaine which is an illegal
drug
as well as we found some documents which
relate to financial institutions like
bank of america u.s banks bank td bank
fell
fargo and couple of credit union
that was totally under your name and
your social security number
so do you have 22 bank under your name
miss maria
no i don't how how many banks you are
banking with under your name
one and what is the bank name
a bank of maharashtra
bank of maharashtra bank of maharashtra
and can you just tell me or where your
bank
you have opened the account originally
in mumbai mumbai no not mumbai
yeah because i was living in india
for some years you know this is so
confusing
no no there are well what is your
current address where you're
residing right now in the u.s north
carolina
not okay and what is your sitcom
yes please what is the zip code just
tell me your zip code 2 8 2
6 2. which bank you're banking in
north carolina right now it's bank of
america no it's fifth third bank
okay i i knew it's uh like a
fifth third bank correct yeah
and in this since how long you are with
this time
for two years 2018. okay
from five years you are having the
bank name under your name that is fifth
or bank and this you are having checking
and saving both
yeah so approximately in checking how
much funds you're holding currently
approximately and checking and
and uh in checking and saving
in total yeah no checking
checking around five thousand dollars
oh it's a twenty five thousand dollars
and what about the saving eleven
thousand dollars
when trying to save money but it's just
difficult you know
eleven thousand okay and [ __ ] okay and
can you tell me which other bank you're
banking with
no that's it that's the only bank i'm
banking with
this person and do you have any credit
card under your name
uh actually no i cancelled each and
everything
okay so you are having on your name only
one bank that is the fifth
or bank okay
so now you need to listen now you need
to listen carefully
okay now the question arises when we are
investigating with those
financial institute and we found
thousands of dollars being buyers from
those accounts
locally and internationally which
totally seems suspicious
yes whom you are talking to marian
i'm trying to ask you something like a
question you have a question
i'm talking to myself i guess yeah
sorry i'm talking to myself because i'm
very
like surprised okay yeah i'm sorry no no
no no
no need to no need to surprise
everything will be all right
okay don't take attention we are here to
help you out okay
thank you i'm just a little bit confused
i'm a little worried you know
like thinking about what's going on
right now your name is under federal
investigation in the state of texas
with three criminal charges press
against your name which is
drug trafficking money laundry and
supporting to terrorism as we are having
very short time and what you have done
is totally against the law of united
states treasury
and we have to sign the arrest warrant
against your name and
we have to suspend your social security
right away
now
is
i'm sorry okay you don't understand you
mean to say
like that chris yeah because you're
saying that you're
i mean the social security number is
going to suspend my social security
should i go slowly
yeah please despacito should i go slowly
all right okay thank you i'll go slow
now okay
now particularly for this
reason two of our officer
they are having watch on you since last
two to three days
and your phone calls were also being
trapped by them
but they did not found suspicious
in your daily route line from that
investigation
we came to know that you might be or you
might not be
involved in this case and it can also be
a matter of identity theft
i am having a quick question for you so
have you
ever lost your wallet or any personal
information in the past few years
no never i'm always a very careful
forever
i'm always very careful with each and
everything
[Music]
your personal information on any unknown
website over the internet
yes on amazon amazon.com
i do a lot of online shopping and
do you suspect someone do you suspect
someone who can do this kind of activity
like your friends or from your family
or neighbor or related do you suspect
somebody who can use your social
um i'll say maybe my friend my indian
friend
hindustani larka okay okay
so you suspect your friend who can you
who is using your social correct
yeah he's from india hindustani okay
all right so we just gone through your
cash record and we found your past
record are good
that is the only reason to try to reach
you before you face
an illegal consequence so in this case
we are going to suspend your social
right now to catch the real culprit for
that
we need your corporation so are you
ready to cooperate with us
to catch the real culprit yes or no
what to cooperate what do i have to do
yeah
will you when you co-produce with us to
catch the real culprit
who is using your social so will you
correct with
us yes or no yes i am
i'm willing to okay so we have to
so we have to suspend your social right
away from your name and we have to issue
new social for you so that we can catch
the suspect as well as
you can save yourself from this kind of
fraudulent activity
so can you just tell me like how many
family members do you have in your
family right now
well i'm single i don't i don't have any
family
remember no okay you live alone you live
alone
yes i do because i can mention like each
and everyone my mom that brother or
sister i have a lot of siblings but
what is the point like i have my auntie
uncle
i don't know no they're there they're
all they are living it's uh it's you
they are living or you are living alone
no they're living in mumbai
mumbai okay so now as you are agreed to
cooperate with the social security
department let me transfer this call to
the senior officer
with the social security department who
can help you
out for further procedures can you
please give me one minute
because i i need to use the restroom
can you please like give me can you
please give me a minute because i need
to use the restroom
what you are
do you have car car do you have any car
under your name yes i do
okay you drive it right yeah which car
is yours
it's a toyota corolla okay and and do
you
have your home under your name are you
renting
okay you need to okay you need to come
first i'm holding the line up i'll be
right back in a minute thank you
okay okay no problem i'm holding the
line thank you man
okay so uh so you went to washroom and
now it's done correct yes thank you
okay so now you need to talk to me okay
seriously because this is a serious
matter
going on under your social all right
yes so i was asking that
you have your house under your name
or you are in renting no i'm renting
yeah
now what i will do you are with fifth
third
and you are having and that checking and
saving
yeah so in checking you are having 25
0
approach and you are having in saving
and anything you are having 11 000
so what i'll do i will transfer the line
to my senior
higher authority and now they will be
explaining you how you can resolve this
case
and how you can save your money okay
so just stay connected to me i'll
transfer to them
is it fine for you it is perfect yeah is
it fine
mario yeah it's fine thank you man
all right all right thank you just stay
connected to me okay
all right thank you i'll hold the line
okay thank you
all right thank you thank you so much
hold the line
okay thank you for holding your line
your
line has been transferred to senior
investigating officer
this is officer shawn fulton am i
sticking with mario or verma
yes
with the drugs trafficking and money
laundering charges have been placed
under your name
have you ever spent money outside of the
united states
or have you ever received money outside
of the united states without informing
the fragile government internal revenue
service well i mean
i don't think i'm supposed to let them
know that i'm sending money to my family
each and every month
i mean like it's not like i'm sending
millions you know what i mean
i'm not sending like millions of
thousands you need to inform them
i'm not asking you that you need to
inform them while you are sending the
money but
you are paying your taxes it should be
in the racket that you are sending money
to somewhere else
yeah did you say it you guessed you have
spent money outside of the united states
right
yes each and every time
which country did you have spent money
india
which country india
let's say india india yeah
is there any relatives or family members
are
residing there or to whom you were
spending money yeah
mommy brothers is there
do you know anybody who is taking drugs
or dealing interrupts nearby you because
there is a drug trafficking case if
you're sending money in
the country india that doesn't matter
because there is no problem with that
thing because we are
investigating the accounts we have found
out there are more than
22 bank accounts presented your name and
under your social security number
and most of those accounts have been
used for the suspicious transactions
and the narco-trafficking countries and
terrorist countries like colombia
mexico nigeria and pakistan
these countries are a countries and a
terrorist country
countries and more than 300 thousand
dollars have been wired
um and those countries are in the states
what do i have to do with that i mean
hello at this moment we have to
investigate this case
you were involved by our officers
changed last couple of days
your phone calls were being kept by our
department and we have not found
any evidence against you and we were
thinking that you might be not involved
in this crime
and you are completely unaware about
this crime that's the reason we have
gave you a call and we haven't shown you
about this ongoing federal investigation
that someone has got your information
and someone else is misusing your
information
so we have got the permission from the
legal department to pick you up
i'm sorry what's your language you're
talking to me
like i'm trying to understand here but
it's kind of
like i don't know what you're trying to
understand english man
[Music]
sometimes am here
at this moment we are asking you that we
have an order from the courthouse of
washington
and they have issued a notification to
our department
to freeze all the bank accounts which
are linked under your name and which are
linked under your social security number
and all the bank accounts which are
linked with your name
and your social security number if it is
keeping more than 500 dollars
all the money will get chosen by the u.s
surgery department
so at this moment before we go ahead and
freeze all the bank accounts under your
name
we can simply know that you are not a
criminal so do you have any intention to
safeguard
all the money in the government safety
local and get all the money back from
the u.s treasury department with your
new social security number
for the next 48 hours or it is okay that
we can directly go ahead and freeze all
your bank accounts
forever
[Music]
yeah please you're speaking very very
fast
you cannot understand english in fact
again
[Music]
sometimes at this moment
we have received a notification
from the courthouse of washington they
have issued a notification to our
department
to go hack and freeze all the bank
accounts which are holding
more than 500 under your name
and as you said you are don't have more
than 25 bank accounts under your name
so do you have any intention to save god
your money
under your name and the government
safety local
and get it back tomorrow with your new
social security number
fourth do you want us to go further
and hand issue a notification to freeze
your bank accounts forever
well i want to cooperate i told the
other officer i want to cooperate
so you need to go to your bank and you
need to transfer all the funds in the
government safety local account for
24 hours until we cancel the arrest
warrant under your name how am i
supposed to do that how am i supposed to
do that with my
bank account
you need to go to your bank we're gonna
give you the government safety local
account
you need to transfer all the funds just
keep one thousand dollars
in your bank account and all other funds
should be transferred in the government
safety local accounting
safety laws can you be in a hole for a
second i don't think that you can
understand
english at this moment all right this
you said you're is india right yeah i
lived uh
for six seven years in kolkata sector
five
then we moved to mumbai and then i moved
to america for study and
then some work but
yeah it's a little bit difficult for me
but yeah i can see if there is let us
see if there was any
indian translator or officer would give
a visit
all right thank you
thank you for holding your line your
line has
you should have told me that since the
very beginning
oh
[Music]
[Music]
oh
[Music]
I saw this video on Twitter with over five million views and then again on YouTube with nearly 1 million views
"Basically, this guy modified his cellphone case with propellers to take selfies"
"Which is awesome my only issue with it is that it's not only fake, but it's a scam which I'll explain in a minute"
but as for being fake
The first clue is that these are three volts seven millimeter micro brush motors like you see here if you attach one to a beam
Like this and turn it on at full throttle you'll see the most weight that it can lift is six quarters or about thirty grams.
The cell phone in the video with all the flying gear attached would weigh about 300 grams
and since drones are typically designed to hover at 70% max thrust you would need at least
"15 of these motors to do what he did, but you know, this just doesn't look as catchy"
"In fact, we recreated the exact setup"
he used in the video and turn the motors to full throttle and this is what happened here.
Here it is in slow mo and as you can see there's hardly any difference than if you don't turn the propellers on at all
so I'm gonna show you how this scam artist somehow manages to break the laws of physics four more times in this three-minute video and
then because obeying laws of physics isn't optional
we're gonna call a fellow youtuber Captain Disillusion to see if he can help us spot any signs of a special effects. And then
with my buddy Peter Sripol i'm going to show you what it would take to
Actually build a flying selfie phone case and then i'll put all the details on a new set. I built using wix.com.
"But, before I do any of that"
let me first explain why this is a scam and not just a harmless fake video for meaningless internet points.  With this many views and
"An astounding 80% like ratio, which means most people probably didn't realize it was fake"
It's a statistical certainty that some young aspiring engineer
actually tried to build this themselves
worse than their parents phone dropping like a rock and breaking
"this might have been his or her first experience at making something.  But, how you might ask would they know what components to use well?"
here in the description amazing maker was kind enough to put links Amazon affiliate links
you can tell by the URLs.
So he is making money off the crushed dreams of aspiring engineers without enough experience yet to this is total BS and aspiring engineers
"are my people, and you don't mess with my people."
Let's do this
the second gratuitous violation of physics comes in this scene the force of gravity always points down but helicopter spinning blades create a force perpendicular
to the blades themselves
so if you want to hover you need to be level so the forces will cancel out and you won't move if you tilt forward
and then break the thrust force into its x and y components
you suddenly have an unbalanced force that will move you in that direction in essence
that's how helicopters move forward by tipping forward in other words
It's physically impossible to hover in an orientation like this
The forward thrust component is unbalanced and it would have to move the phone forward
The third major issue is the Arduino compatible circuit board
he chose.  It's the same board here and it's supposed to be the brains for the drone
"yet, this specific model of board doesn't come with any sort of gyroscope or accelerometer."
"Here's why that matters if you've ever tried,"
balancing something on your hand like this you and your body we're creating what's referred to as a closed-loop feedback control system.
So if it starts to tip over my eyes relay that to my brain and my hand says hey
I'm no longer fuelling the weight just up and down
it's also pushing my hand this way and so my brain takes all that information and
responds by telling my hand to move this way at a specific speed in order to compensate.
"So, to keep this thing balanced there's this continuous loop of quickly gathering information and then making real-time adjustments and closed feedback"
loops are used all over in engineering from the simple case of a thermostat that
continuously checks the air and turns on at a certain temperature to
dart boards that update their position 200 times a second to get a bull's-eye every time
to machines that are abused and most certainly for anything that flies and needs to stay in the air the fact that his board is
missing a gyroscope and an accelerometer
means there's no way for it to tell if it's starting to rotate or to fall in any direction
It's the equivalent of trying to balance the board wearing a blindfold and an oven mitt
you have no idea what adjustments to make to keep things balanced.  Which is the perfect lead-in to the fourth major physics
Flaw notice how he attaches these motors and rigidly fixes them to the phone double-stick tape
this means if you start to tip forward
you have no way to self-correct the phone
"orientation and it would just turn into a nosedive, if you only have two propellers in this configuration"
they both need to be able to rotate with respect to the phone in order to correct the movements in all six degrees of freedom
for example if it starts to tip forward
you could rotate them both back like this
to correct for that.  Or if the wind is trying to spin the phone this way they could assume this configuration to
counter that to return to our balancing shovel analogy by fixing the motors directly to the case
you lose your ability to even make corrections
"so not only do you have no idea where to move, but your arm is locked out for making adjustments anyways"
which makes it literally impossible to balance.
Owwww.
My final physics issue with this video is one of acoustics
this guy proposes using it as a hands-free way to watch your favorite super hip music videos
conveniently dubbing over the audio here
for reference this is what an episode of the office would sound like on a phone at full volume
and don't forget that you would actually need 13 more motors than this so it would be at least six times louder.  [Extremely Loud Whirling Sound]
So now that we thoroughly established a multitude of physical laws have been broken.
Let's find out exactly how he faked it and to do that
I've arranged video call with the undisputed heavyweight champion of the bunking fake videos using special effects Captain disillusion
Be sure to get it as flush as possible against your skin to minimize folds that might make it hard to
chroma key out like this
nice and tight
Captain oh hi Mart Mart robber you weren't supposed to call yet. It's 2 o'clock
"I'm actually even 5 minutes late, really."
Well then.
How can I help you
did you not even watch the video I sent
"ah, yes, of course the mobile drone video"
I've analysed that thoroughly mark and my conclusion is it's totally real
"Seriously, yes"
"Everything except for the mobile drone part, that's fake"
if you look very
closely
You might just be able to make out the huge
chattering mask on the side of the phone
Visible in every shot of it flying the creator must have been in a real hurry because it's so messy here
it cuts off the edge of the phone here the tip of his finger and here it reveals the thing
it's supposed to be hiding a rod. It's narrow and light-colored and probably attached with the same mounting tape
He used to tack on all the other gadgets
That's why he's able to grab and adjust the phone in this shot by the river the mask hides not just the stick
But the whole person holding it look closer on this site the real-time
Water and on this side a still frame from an empty version of the shot
And if we track the phone's position and rotation we can easily
Reverse-engineer exactly how the stick puppeteer did rotating mostly from the point where it was held
Wow
That was very impressive captain D
Thank you for taking the time favorite part of this whole thing is the audio
The tiny propellers must have made so little noise at a distance. It didn't give a proper drone vibe
So the hoaxers recorded the sound of the motors up close and reused the same clip in every scene
complete with their muttering voices in the background
[Whirling Noise and Muffled Voices]
"Awesome well, thanks again."
"But, even though impressive is the number of posts messages and tweets"
Presumably from people with functioning eyeballs asking me if this painfully obvious edit is real over and over.
"Okay, captain will take care. I've got to go back to my even you mark how could you do this to me?"
How could you do?
He's such a joker. So let's fake and now you know
exactly all the reasons why but still a really interesting idea and I was curious what it would look like if you actually
built one of these at using less special effects and more practical engineering.
"So, naturally I called in my buddy Peter Shree people whose qualifications"
Include building his own electric flame from scratch and he immediately got to work.
Turns out if you take two brushless motors to electronic motor speed controllers a flight controller that actually has a gyroscope and an accelerometer
Integrated a 3d printed frame and two servos to articulate the rotors a radio
transmitter for remote control and a force the lipo battery and then you put them all together it actually works.
Kind of we had to do a bunch of test flights to calibrate that
Feedback control loop we talked about before
so if we notice the drone is either under
compensating or over compensating when it starts to fall in a certain way
we tweak the response
sensitivity in between flights until we get to the sweet spot and I should mention remember how the motors from the fake video could barely
"Lift only six quarters. Well, if you properly sized them for the task at hand, they should be able to lift 150 quarters."
And so once we felt like we had it in pretty good shape. We took her out for the maiden test flight
[Music Plays]
They in our defense it was a little windy out there
"but as you can see, it can be pretty wobbly at times the truth is a bike copter like this totally works"
it just isn't a great design choice.
The reason pretty much all camera drones are quad copters is because they're much more stable due to a larger footprint shared between four motors
and by getting clever with the throttle speeds you can move in all six degrees of freedom with no moving parts
So there you go with solid engineering. You don't need hidden rods or masking and rotoscoping and Sir Isaac Newton can once again
"comfortably rest in his grave. So, the moral of the story is just don't cheat and lie in scam"
I actually considered going a little easier on Amazing Maker
but then I happen to scan some of his other videos like this knee brace that
Charges your phone and even powers this flashlight as you walk in theory
I'll skip the details
but in reality this system would also never work as shown which is why if you whine that and stabilize on his hand in the
pocket you see him click a hidden flash light switch.
[Boom]
If you want to build a flying selfie foam case yourself
you can watch the video Peter made with all the juicy details. You can find that on his channel or new website
"I created called mark rover build instructions.com, and on that site and"
"you'll actually see build instructions for tons of different projects from my channel, which was made possible by the fine folks at wix.com"
I wanted something simple and classy and I almost feel a little guilty
I can make something dysfunctional and it only took about an hour in part. Thanks to a series of questions
you answer when you get started
that means right off the bat
"you're close to what you want,"
but you can still customize it as much as you like from there
including lining it with one of the hundreds of templates they have and my website is just a simple way to communicate information
but you can make one for your personal brand or your
"portfolio, or maybe a new website for your business to sell stuff, or even book appointments right there.  And it's free to sign up to"
start designing and publishing and it's honestly a lot of fun.
"So, to flex your creative muscles for the whole world to see go to wix.com"

"at least 15,000 Americans lost more than"
300 million dollars collectively during
the four-year scam according to the feds
callers from centers in India posed as
federal agents to threaten victims with
arrest imprisonment fines or deportation
if they didn't pay up according to an 81
page indictment unsealed
Thursday the 61 suspects that were
arrested face charges of conspiracy to
commit identity theft false personation
of an officer of the United States wire
fraud and money laundering one of the
victims who identified herself only as
Christine told the Wall Street Journal
that she was warned to pay six thousand
eight hundred fifty dollars in back
taxes or face arrest
the following day another victim a

so i was looking up how to clear paypal
holds
and then i dialed this number
you see how that comes up
hello
hello
hello you know i'm gonna put this on
youtube right
thousand dollars
what about the movement
all right guys so let me walk through
the steps on how they
completed the scam once they answered
um i had to say hello i was surprised
i said hello hello is this paypal so the
answer yes is paypal
they told me in order to see what's
going on
with my paypal they need to
gain remote access so they told me to
download this go to assist remote
support
app which i did once you download that
um it wants you to specify your name and
support key it's like a fourth
six digit number so once they obtain
that they
want me to show their screen so which i
did
and then as i was explaining what was
going on they were attempting to bring
up a transfer funds to this
account which i was saying like wait
wait hold on something isn't right you
know i say what is going on
but as i was starting to um shut down or
restart my computer
i think they have they were able to
complete the transaction
so the amount they trying to transfer
wasn't small guys
it was a couple of zeros let me tell you
i didn't have
enough funds in there that's where
it had to kick into a transaction
through my bank
in order to cover the amount that they
requested
so that's when i decided to end the call
and call my paypal and explain to them
what happened
well i explained to a lady what happened
um
telling how the scam was completed the
number that i dialed from a google
search
initially it said the transaction was
completed
but as they processed my claim it looks
like right now is
a refund impending
so that's when they urge me to change my
password which i did
after i hung up i decided to call my
local bank explain to them what happened
and trying to put a stop hold on any
transfer funds but they were
saying that none is showing right now i
also changed the password on that and i
told them i would be on the lookout
for any fraudulent activities
or transactions they also urge me to
come in and
just change to a brand new
checking account and cancel my old one
so after i hung up with the bank letting
them know that
i would be on lookout every day to make
sure there are new
crazy activities going on and that's
when i also downloaded this bitdefender
make sure
this is one of the highest rated ones on
the internet right now
so i ran a full scan everything is shows
fine
there are any malware in the virus on my
computer
i think right now i'm safe so be
diligent guys
um i've only shared my
computer uh twice one with dell help
support when i was going through a
operating system error
when i couldn't um i had like a could
start a
computer or something like that and then
this time so be very cautious
think twice before you want to share it

phone number or website take care of

gonna walk you through how to block
colors how to set up spam protection and
how to block unknown colors as well on
your Samsung Galaxy phone now it might
be slightly different if you have this
is an unlocked version of the phone so
I'm going to show you on this one might
be slightly different if you have a
carrier version of the phone so just
keep that in mind but anyways it's very
very simple first thing I'm to do is
open up your phone app the phone app
that you make calls in once you have
that open hit the three dots in the top
right and go to settings and everything
is right here you're gonna go right into
block numbers and you can block unknown
College if you have that turned on you
won't get any calls from blocked numbers
it's a really quick and easy way to
block those calls that don't show any
phone number at all where it says
unknown colors otherwise you can keep
that on if you keep it I mean off if you
keep it off you will get the calls you
could turn on you won't get those
unknown calls I chosen it if it doesn't
show a number if you want to add or
remove people that you add phone numbers
that you blocked come in here so save
the phone number is eight hundred eight
seven six five three five three that
called you that's that's the old phone
number from unsolved mysteries if you
remember that show back in the 80s 90s
going there you type in the number hit
add and now you won't get any calls from
that phone number you can also remove
numbers as well by hitting a little
minus sign next to it it's that simple
to remove and add numbers in there
taking a step back you can also go in to
caller ID and spam protection turn that
on when it turns on on you can see it
uses highe which is a service to
identify spam and scam colors you'll
also see the names and profile photos of
colors who aren't in your contacts you
can also share your name and number as
well if you tap on that and you can
share all that information with them so
kind of cool that you can go in there
and and share that information so there
you guys go that is how to block phone
numbers how to remove phone numbers that
you block that you don't want to block
anymore how to block unknown callers as
well and block spam and scam callers
very very easy again it might be
slightly different on your version
the phone but this if you have an
unlocked version of the phone that's how
it works and it should work with almost
any galaxy phone that you have thanks
for watching see you down the road
Paytm scammers just called my friend
Caron while we're here editing my videos

they could verify his documents for
Paytm which is an electronic money
wallet here and as soon as they get
access to your phone to your computer

first cook you actually started doing
what he said right
sounded like a lizard person and I
wondered like I haven't quite learned it
enough to get things but my parents they
might have got catfish yeah because he
sounded like an alleged radium person
and that's how paid in people cause like
when I worked for the official kyc done
that's how they called me so those of
you watching it just keep in mind we'll
send an official medium message to it
it's a little thing but I don't think
they will ever ask for access to your
device so that's that's that that leeway
how you know this is a scam because that
guy was asking for access to my device
and he was wanted to capture my whole
scheme through his device he asked me to
download this app and he tells me remote
control I downloaded it first so I just
went to the reviews of the app so that's
what you should do and all the reviews
say this is scam don't get under this
and I don't think my parents are like
what the people will be aware of this
and they will go through this is
downloaded say to me just make sure they
send an official message regarding it
and they will never ask for it it says
to everybody why will it do that yeah
hold and then at what point did he hang
up on you
this is the neck godd bathroom and i
poking at me I said dude don't try to do
this I'm gonna put you at the police yes
Commerce we're in goddamn still so angry

alright guys I'm home now it's monsoon
so it's it's raining and once these guys
get access to your phone or your
computer they black your screen they
turn your screen off so you can't watch
them draining the money out of your
account
that's the scam that's how they're gonna
drain your money without you even
knowing now these guys call you I want
you to blast them use all the golly you
know K Teddy marques then come on use
all these words on them and just blast
them as hard as you can these guys are
just criminals and I want you to share
this video of all your family and
friends so they can avoid getting
scammed by these guys too because it is
just so prevalent here in India J hunt
and if you're new here my name is Carl
rock and check out my youtube channel
and you can watch a ton of other scam
videos and lots of India travel videos
so I keep foreigners safe and help and
travel here in India and Indians too
actually
well beware the next time the phone
rings you may be targeted by a scam and
not even know it ross is here now to
explain
how this one works ross okay well you
get a call
you've been a victim of fraud you hang
up you call your bank and then that's
when the trap begins
the phone rings the caller says hello
this is
bank security she told me my card had
been compromised
two people same scam she suggested i
call the number on the back of my credit
card
and ask for a fellow by the name of
stephen in the fraud department
i hung up and then i immediately picked
up my phone and the dial tone
did not sound correct so ron cabara used
his cell phone instead
audrey cerney didn't maybe i was in such
a panic and fluster that i didn't even
realize
that there was no dial tone i couldn't
even honestly tell you
we know there's delayed disconnects even
though you hang up
on landline phones the caller can remain
on the line
it could be seconds or in audrey cerny's
case she says a couple minutes
the scammers play a dial tone and you
think you dialed your bank
but the imposter is still on the line
asking me my email address my credit
card number
to confirm it birth date
full name things like that even the
security code on the card
it was over twenty three thousand
dollars that they ended up spending
and it's still an ongoing issue that we
see here today at the anti-fraud center
you know in today's world you gotta
wonder if the delayed disconnect feature
even
is needed it was put in place years ago
so you could hang up and pick up the
call in another room while the caller
remained on the line
that is wrong that should be changed
absolutely immediately
they both have shaw as their provider
shaw told ctv news they are
working with our teams internally to
shorten our call
clearing delay time to help reduce the
risk posed by this type of fraudulent
activity
telus says its landline can stay active
for up to 10 seconds after you hang up
rogers which provides landline service
in ontario new brunswick and
newfoundland
disconnects after 10 seconds as well and
bell the parent company of ctv
didn't disclose any information about
its disconnect times
if you get one of those calls don't give
out any information
hang up and wait up to 10 minutes or use
a cell phone to call your bank
the canadian anti-fraud center says the
calls often come early
early morning by early morning you know
you haven't woken up you haven't had
your coffee and
you create that situation of urgency
so you sort of get that emotion involved
the panic the fear
to get you to hang up and immediately
call your bank
that's what they always tell you to do
if your card is lost or stolen or
compromised to call the number on the
back
but in this case it didn't do me any
good
she says the crooks first tested her
card with a five dollar charge in
ontario she noticed that charge the next
day and reported it to her bank but at
that time
her bank said they'd rang up 23 grand in
charges which she didn't
end up having to pay those charges were
pending yeah these
scammers getting pretty crafty aren't
they ross good news for that victim she
didn't have to pay that money but others
have been out of pocket here
yeah they have so last year five
vancouver seniors were duped in a
similar scam
the same called disconnect trip was used
to duke them into transferring huge sums
of money about three
million dollars more than two million of
that was recovered but there still
is a huge loss there yeah i got to be
careful all right thanks ross

"nevermind that we're going to deport you
so treated like spam ignore it delete it"
"hang up on on these callers and whatever
you do don't call them back if you"
suspect that they might be fraudulent
they tried to scare me so i played along
to reveal how the scam
works the scammers have a method to get
you
to call them so they could scam you
this is pretty darn smart let me show
you what you need to know
let's do this
by now most of us know not to click on
links in our emails
and even if we do our anti-virus is
probably smart enough
to get in the way and say hey do not get
onto this dodgy website
but these scammers have found a way
around it and it's smart
so let's walk through this scam step
number one you get an email that looks
like
this notice how in the email there isn't
a single link it is well written
there is no spam words so it bypasses
all the spam filters and lands up
straight in your mailbox
since many of us do use services online
and do sign up for free trials
this is highly probable and yes some
free trials
require you to put in your credit card
details even though they don't bill you
but in order to get through your free
trial that's what you got to do
so now what well on this email
there are only three pieces of
information
info piece number one is the email
address usually scammers use
gmail but this one comes from gmx.com
what is that i go to google and type at
gmx.com surrounded by quotation marks
and i see that this is a free email
service supported by ads so
not gmail but gmail alike info piece
number two is the address
now i look up the address that's written
at the bottom of the email
using google maps maybe this will give
me a clue because remember
at this stage i'm still not sure if this
is legit or not legit
so google maps come to my rescue okay
fire up google maps now i'm going to
paste the address that's in there
and i see it's a legit address which is
always a good start
let's zoom in and see if there any
businesses that are registered there
anything that maybe would recognize
yeah not really nothing that i would
have signed up
for so the next option let's go to
street view sometimes these places on
the map
they've got signage outside now this is
a pretty tall building they did say was
something like the 19th floor
so this all does tie up so so far again
a bit
skeptical but maybe it is maybe it isn't
next thing is i'm going to do is walk
around the building just looking for any
signs or clues
of anything that would recognize and um
yeah still pretty much a non-descript
building with
no signage whatsoever okay what's next
and for piece number three is the phone
number this is where things get
interesting because i decide i'm gonna
call this number but i'm gonna use a
disposable cell phone number
obviously lovely
customer services lady answers and she
asked me for my customer
id that is the bcy number in the email
i give that to her she confirms my name
and the company i work for
i figure she kind of gets that from the
email address that it was addressed to
i wonder what she would have said if my
email address was something like
hot chicks32 at gmail.com
anyways she then asked me about my
medical service and she's excited to see
that i'm upgrading to the premium plan
i told her hold on i have no idea what
this was all about
she seemed surprised and proceeded to
type frantically on her keyboard
because i could hear the click click
click of the keyboard right
now this is where the scammers magic
happens she cuts better on the line and
she says look
so sorry there must have been some
mix-up you need to cancel it before your
credit card gets pulled
don't worry i'm going to step you
through that i'm audience
she gives me a website address go
imed.us here is what the site looks like
and i must say it looks pretty darn
professional
she says click at the top click on get
imad and then click on the link which is
unsubscribe
which i do it then tells me to enter my
number you can enter
any eight digit number number letter
combination
i followed the instruction i entered my
bcy number
and here's where the next thing happens
it wants to download an
excel document onto your computer now
it downloads it perfectly fine because
it's just an excel document
your anti-virus doesn't kick in because
there's nothing wrong with this
particular document
i asked her what this document is she
said it was just a digital
signature confirmation that you do want
to cancel the service so you're not
going to get bold
so how does the scam actually work well
it works when you try
running the document that's when i see a
warning message at the top saying this
contains macros okay
this is how the scam works essentially
when you enable those macros
it goes out onto the internet and grabs
a whole bunch of malware
and installs it onto your computer now
it could be something as simple as
adding your computer to a bot network
or something like ransomware which
encrypts your computer
and then they say hey pay us a whole
bunch of bitcoin and we'll unlock your
computer for you
so you can see why this scam would work
people think they're digitally signing a
document which we're used to doing
online
but in the meantime in the background
these macros are kicking in and doing
who knows what to your computer
make sure you share this with absolutely
everybody that you know so
nobody gets caught up in this particular
scale check out
this video over here which is checks if
you've been hacked on your cell phone
like this video and give it a thumbs up
if you did enjoy it and i'll see you in
this video
or i'll see you in this video well bye
i'll see you in both videos let's go
okay so this is another scam warning i
received this this morning and
this was the call that i received
claiming to be
from amazon hi this is an automated call
from amazon
we are suspicious because we have
received an order number
amzx uti zed for iphone 11
cost price is 1049 pounds from your card
which has been recently used with amazon
account press
one if you ordered or press
two if you want to speak to the
cancellation officer regarding this
order thank you so the call
is simple scare tactics it's designed
to try and scare you into believing that
your
card has been charged 1049 pound
for an iphone 11 that they claim you've
purchased
from amazon now as i say this
is a scam so don't fall for it just hang
up don't say anything
if you've got any suspicions
that your card has been charged then
check with your bank
check with your credit card provider or
go into your amazon account and check
your recent orders
if an order has gone through then it
would be shown
on your card statement or your online
banking
or it will be also be shown on your
amazon account
amazon would never phone you with an
automated call
about any order uh obviously the current
uh scam that seems to be going around
that a lot of people are getting
are saying that you've been charged for
amazon prime
and again that is a scam so if you do
receive
any calls from amazon then
take it with a pinch of salt i'll be
99.9
sure that it will be a scam as amazon
never ever call you as i say if you do
get one of these calls
and you're not sure then check with your
bank your credit card
or check with amazon themselves by
logging on to your account
and checking your orders and it will
show up in your orders if it's true and
it will give you
the opportunity there to contact amazon
to discuss the order or if you can't do
either
of those then you can contact amazon on
their official free phone number in the
uk
which is oh 800 279
7234 that's oh 800
279
please share this video especially with
anyone
that you think may fall foul to this
kind of scam
please share it on your social media
timelines that would be great
to stop anyone else from getting scammed

advice if you end up talking with a
scammer on the other end never give out
their date of birth their social
security number bank account information

share my social security number with
anybody

accounts do you own as for your
knowledge and information
I don't think it's appropriate for me to
share that information with you I'm not

to give them details I would like to

any money they're trying to help well I
just don't understand why I'm giving you
my I would like to know what the
allegations are against me and what
you're going to take out a warrant for
well that's better than the 25 the first
guy told me were out against me and they
hung up on me find it interesting that

and the second guy talked to was Jason
Brown so folks these are scam calls

found on the web about anywhere so don't

bank account information nothing like
that they're all scammers just hang up
on them or have a little fun

would have told us some authorities to
report the case to eventually end up in
us sending money as something that can
be held as a deposit that will be
verified by some banker and you'll get
the money after the investigation is
where the thing is once the money is
sent

administration office my name is officer
charles williams how can i help yeah
what's going on okay first of all let me
tell you so
because i'm just asking this question to
you we have an order to suspend your
social security number right this moment
now since innovation then was the u.s
drug enforcement administration act
section 28 under united states core 134
is the case out verify me first of all
if you are willing to cooperate with me
i'm gonna remove your name with this
case i'm gonna help you in this case
yeah i if you're that's not me that's i

transfer this call to my chief officer
who will be guiding you better in this
situation okay do not hang up the call
at all because he will be guiding you

with this case because you are an
innocent person with ryan is it mr
richard johansson
yeah richard johnson
it's richard johnson is that correct
yeah
hi mr johnson how are you doing today
i'm a little bit a little bit worried if
i'm honest i don't
i don't fully understand what's going on
it's okay to be worried sir
let me explain you what exactly is going
on so basically
your social security number is misused
for these crimes which are drug
trafficking and money laundering
basically we've got these 24 bank
accounts on the unanimous social
security number which have been misused
to transfer money to mexico and colombia
and we've also got some more banks in an
apartment checking your records i see
that you're banking information that
contains genuine records and your social
has no other complaints in the past
right so right that is the reason we
believe this is a case of identity theft
right and that is why what we can do
right now in order to help you out
yeah
in order to help you out that's what i
was thinking because i i don't i
actually used to volunteer
when they yeah remember the uh
dare programs
where they would bring in the police
officers and all that they tell the kids
not to do the drugs
well i used to volunteer right right and
i would go
and i would go and i'd give little
presentations and i used to have a
little puppet
and i i had this puppet that i bring up
there on stage and i do a little skit
for the kids
you know and it used to be a real hoop
they loved me over there
and so i i'm i never you know i don't
support any of those kind of
those kind of drugs
right
so
mr johnson
and he just says no
i still remember it like it was
yesterday
to inform you about this case the
actions that are to be taken on your
social security number is to get it
suspended
now
we have to and in which ways we have to
suspend your social security number
because
we do not want those criminals to use
your identity again but the thing is
that we are not fighting this case
against you anymore we are helping you
resolve it
it's going to help you take your name
out of this right so i'm going to guide
you on how you can yeah so i'm going to
guide you on how you can safeguard your
accounts and assets
first of all i'm going to help you
safeguard the bank accounts with bank of
america
and that
in that case yeah
so what i'm going to do is i'm going to
guide you everything step by step so
they don't make any mistakes i'm going
to help you disconnect your assets and
accounts from your current social
so that we can suspend your social and
leave your assets and accounts
unaffected
and tomorrow when you get your new
social right right so i'm going to help
you first i'm going to help you withdraw
the funds thank you okay
let me tell you what's going to happen
sir mr johnson i'm going to help you
with all the funds from the bank in the
form of cash and convert it into
electronic currency so that tomorrow
when the officers visit you they can
take that electronic currency from you
and they can give you a cashier check
for the total value okay okay but why do
i have to take it out of my bank i guess

that time Marjorie had an affair with
one of them and I had it found him
hiding under the bed no I did span your
spaniel it's not a home improvement loan
it's a spaniel well I'll explain you see
I just taken out just finished my fourth
gin and tonic of the morning or I might
even be in the face
anyway the tortoise was chasing the
spaniel around the room he's always a
bit frisky when he comes out of
hibernation you see and he was annoyed
because the spaniel would nicked his
iPod so I got up to pour myself another
drink of the spaniel dash in front of me
and before I know I am whoops-a-daisy or
tripped over the spaniel tripped over
the damn dog yes all right yes well you
know I'm not sure I have any truck with
today's compensation culture you know oh
I stubbed my toe so I deserve to be
paying money for

I don't think you understand what's
going on why I like because you want to
steal my money I am and get my personal
information I mean I watched you try to
get into my bank account and all that
stuff because the screen wasn't actually
black so either someone's lying to you
and you think you actually worked for
Microsoft and it's okay to steal
someone's like personal information
you're just lying to me hello hello
who's this I am a youtuber I make
youtube videos okay so you're aware that
people call your call center because
you're you're like a fake Microsoft
Scanlon yes correct
and then we upload those YouTube videos
and I try to make my family survive
through those YouTube videos
yeah then I don't realize that the
people I'm trying to call and make
youtube videos are actually making 10
times more than me okay
so I would just like to ask you one
question who in your mind gave you this
idea that if you call us and waste time
of my guy you will make money and we
will lose money who told you this so I
don't care I don't care about the money
what I care about it was raising
awareness you're scummy business
practices and how you take advantage of
really raising an event is raising an
event awareness to whom because our
targeted customers are never people of
your age my the targeted customers are
always senior citizen
damn you think I don't think I don't
know that then how will you make an
event how will you make it event it's
pretty easy it's pretty easy like let's
just say hypothetically five million
people saw this scam the shenanigans and
the noise that you tried to pull
then let me they be able to tell their
grandparents and everybody else today
I'll tell you the truth about the life
and after this you will never even dare
to call any scammer I'll tell you
something about mother [ __ ] should I
start
and you're you're angry aren't you did I
make you feel loser right now I'm not
gonna feel like a losers there's nothing
you can do it I'll make it right I'll
make you feel right now I'll make you
feel right now are you ready yeah I'm so
ready so a young guy in America wakes up
in the morning somehow gets hold of a
scam phone number and so when it jetted
to call that scammer and waste his time
right now young American a [ __ ] you [ __ ]
you when I'm talking don't disturb me
don't disturb me don't do that don't do
really think about teachers that much
better than you actually you probably do
that's why you think it is scary why you
scared I'm not scared at all I just
think you are
let me [ __ ] finish so this
American guy the young guy yeah maybe
posture from cold has an adequate job of
somewhere between or you can say which
"is around $4,000 a month"
now this guy's making a good handsome
amount of money as far as he thinks yeah
yeah holds up a scam and he calls up a
scammer and waste his time thinking that
he is actually doing good to himself his
grandpa has grandmom his country on the
other hand on the other hand we're
really talking don't you just like can
you like what does it sound like what
does it sound like when he calls you
like when the the young American who has
no job what does it sound like when it
calls her a call center yeah I go on
with your story it's riveting I swear
this guy who calls yeah make maximum of
"10,000 a month I would just go on a"
higher side and the person who's picking
up a call
"it's camming maybe who likes $10,000 a"
month on YouTube calling scammers no I'm
not saying through YouTube I'm saying to
a regular job or a regular okay okay
imagine imagine that guys not just a
youtuber but also has a regular job you
know he passed out his high yeah cuz
like I don't know how your channel
didn't get D monetized but dang do you
have a script somebody you have a script
prepare for this you know how much I'm
making it Kenny D again you see this is
how you were proving because you don't
know that you are recording the call but
I'm also making YouTube videos and so I
will put this on YouTube but people
would laugh at you because why I'll tell
you because you're not able to answer my
question and maybe your fellow Americans
will laugh at you because you can have
some shame to them okay so we are having
a smart question as around subtitle
question answer route between the
scammer and the America singing dumb my
first question to you is do you know
that this camera you talkin to how much
he makes it a day what car he owes what
what kind of property iou's and his bank
account balance I do not know how much
money you make and I don't care it
doesn't have anything to do with this
conversation today and how do I make
that by making American senior citizens
fool so your grandpa gives me the money
to ride a Rolls Royce a Bentley and live
"in apartment worth more than $200,000"
and you like an [ __ ] not looking for
a job not try to get a girl your courier
is wasting your time calling me and
trying to prove me that I'm doing
something wrong do you really think I
give a [ __ ] about what you say to me I
know I did they I don't

out reflection i appreciate you man hey
honey buddy did you enjoy that call you
missed it live what check us out on
twitch.tv gamerpayback and live
streaming on youtube live baby we'll see
you there
what is going on guys Greg listt I'm
gonna walk you through how to block
phone numbers and unknown colors on your
iPhone it's very very simple so let's
jump right into it first thing you want
to do you would think maybe you'd go
into the call app or the phone app
whatever you want to call it that's not
true you're actually gonna go into
settings once you're in settings you're
gonna work your way down until you see
phone tap on phone and then everything
is going to be within here what you're
gonna go next
you can except you can the first thing
you might want to do is silence unknown
colors it says right here calls from
unknown numbers will be silenced sent to
voicemail and displayed on the recent
list incoming calls will continue to
ring from people in your contacts recent
outgoing calls and serious suggestions
so I'm gonna turn that on if you want to
block call blocking an identification
tap on that and you can see if you have
any apps that will identify phone
numbers for you
like I have yahoo mail so it says allow
these apps to block calls and provide
caller ID and I have my yahoo mail
turned on for that so it's gonna do call
blocking and identification apps are not
able to access any information about
your incoming calls so there you go give
you a little bit of information about
the calls coming in and then lastly
you're gonna see right here you're gonna
see blocked contacts when you come in
here you can add and it says you will
not receive phone calls messages email
or FaceTime from people on the Block
list if you you can choose the contact
that you want to block for instance me
blue tap block this contact and anything
that I get from this person have it be
an email a text whatever it may be it's
all gonna be blocked really simply
really easy and then maybe it's like
your boyfriend you just broke up with
and then you bet you're back with your
boyfriend you want to get calls and
messages and stuff runs come back in
here hit edit and you can delete it as
well it's the same way if you guys go
that it's a little bit of information
for you to block calls and all that kind
of cool stuff with your iPhone thanks
for watching
see down the road

quick Ramesh I got this right sorry
email is I just wasted almost seven
minutes of your time at gmail.com no
there's no issue but you're helping me
make a great YouTube video thanks you're
helping me they're gonna call me back a
thousand times a day so anyway I thought
that was pretty funny I was trying to
think of some clever things to say to
make it funnier but I thought I'd just
waste as much time as I could and then I
thought I did a pretty good job on the
email address there but uh let's go back
and now she said she's gonna put me on
the thousand call a day list I'm so
scared
that would be great cuz I could make a
thousand YouTube videos let's go try to
call her back cuz I do have the number
let's see what happens when we try to
call it the number back let's do this
there we go again
I'll keep trying
yeah nothing did nothing okay so we
tried to call back and now just get like
a busy signal type thing uh so we got to
fail there but anyway I thought it had a
little bit of fun there I could have
kept running a lot a lot longer I think
I just when she asked for the email
address I just couldn't resist so uh
anyway I hope you guys enjoyed the video
as much as I enjoyed making it I loved
when those people call me and her threat
was just hilarious and that might have
been the best part so anyway this is
Joey 66 watch the rest of the video and
maybe do a livestream handle in a while
you guys take care and I will see you
soon
[Music]
thank you for calling sport my name is
Victor how may I'll be yeah hi Victor I
got some kind of voicemail about a
refund yes sir okay we will help you out
to get back your even okay so what do we
have to do the verification process
before that sir you have to get on to
your computer on which will provide the
computer services okay I have it right
here I have my only computer right here
okay okay so first of all sir I will
verify the details from the computer
okay okay so right now sir your computer
is connected to internet okay so click
on Excel right now you see your data
your ID and password can you tell me
what your idea Nebraska all right thank
you now can you tell me how many people
use this computer and what all purposes
we use this computer for well it's just
me that uses it it's kind of like a
personal on a work computer the figure
of our computer or it's for both but I
do own the computer so it is mine yes I
do I know who take care of your computer
if you have any problems with the
computer or will be out I don't know I
kind of just try to figure it out myself
although I'm not very good with
computers to be honest with you not that
I know of now but I've never really had
problems with it okay and what yes I
know it's not Microsoft Word it's just
called WordPad WordPad but why I don't
know hey it's been doing that since I
got it
but WordPad usually works all right okay
and what is this FBI's actually
important and they are not running well
I don't think you should be trying to
open that to be honest yeah but you just
open the thing on your notepad okay till
Denson can I just put these all the
software in a folder if you don't mind
I'm talking about the icons on your
desktop you you want to put them in a
folder yeah I mean I don't mind but what
would you need to do that for
so what do you want me to do stay on the
line okay don't lean on you if you later
yeah this is my cell phone okay I don't
really know anything about the how do we
make a genuine what happened with the
refund I'm supposedly guess windows or
okay I understand so what's going on
with this thing Steve Smith was inviting
you to join a support session hello yeah
I'm here yeah I'm not speaking to mr.
Rieger right that's me yes okay Richard
this is Alex from the billing department
so how are you doing today I'm good how
are you yeah I'm fine I'm crafty and
previously you were talking to one of
color representing and I hope he's very
polite and very understanding to you
yeah yeah he's very polite I just don't
understand because he's telling me to
get a genuine windows I don't know what
that means and he's also telling me I
have a refund ready so I don't know
which one it is I don't know all I heard
was that there's a refund ready for me
so I called back the reason is because
in funding that we are running out of
our business
so we are no longer providing the
services anymore feature okay so we are
calling each and every customers those
who are under the world deeply judge and
jury funding their money back okay first
of all I'm going to log in Calgary
I don't have Chase Bank though I do have
Wells Fargo yeah this is our refund
accountant and I went to I mean so very
fun and fun from data from deewana they
bid the money and registry
no problem
what's all this code on the side of my
screen do I have to worry about that
just there was a bunch of code on the
side of my screen it's not something I
have to worry about or are you taking
care of them you know I would take care
of it okay okay Tennessee I have
successfully log into our refine a song
we find a conscience for a business and
you see that do you see that yeah okay
so from this icon we are gonna debit the
money and put it in share account okay
sir
so I do believe you do online banking
with your bandwidth and receive your
money right yeah yeah but I do it with
Wells Fargo account is how you usually
know did you just type the name off your
back
okay can I ask you a question real quick
though yeah what did you do over here

demonstration purposes only you changed
it to say refund account you literally
just went to a demo page on Chase Bank
and you inspect element' did that to say
something that you'd like this is all
[ __ ] this is a demo page and you
pretended to log in none of this is
actually doing anything you are viewing
the demo this link is not active what
are you doing over there you're
obviously a scammer what are you doing

main page whatever you typed in a
[ __ ] username and password and then
you just pasted a link over here look

I hope you're doing well this particular
video is all about the stem coils that
are going out right now and here in
Ireland so see there lot of scam calls
regarding the accommodation regarding
anything other expenses also but right
now intending they are just calling you
for the immigration purpose so if you
are currently in Ireland then it might
be possible later you get this kind of a
call or in upcoming months like in a
September or October if you are planning
to compile and then also after coming to
Ireland you might get this kind of a
call so aware about this but you call
this their this all the goals are scam I
will put down some of the numbers that I
got from which this kind of a coal are
coming so but obviously they will change
the number after each and every call so
that is of no use but still I will put
all the numbers so over here now the
main thing is that the what they are
asking and how they will approach you so
they'll first call you and then they
will tell you that are you by mystically
fill some incorrect detail in your
immigration phone so you need to leave
this but you can clean unit to go back
to your home country now any coal like
this immigrants and purpose or anything
will come in front of you then obviously
we will get scared but no need to worry
about that particular thing if this kind
of thing is going on with you then first
step is that you need to call to Indian
society over here a lot of people they
will help you for these particular
things so you don't need to worry uses
it to contact Indian society over here
these people are doing excellent work or
this kind of a thing so now first they
will call you you peeled some wrong
detail in your immigration poem so
because of that your visa will get
cancelled your admission College will
get cancelled and you to get back to
your country now they will provide you
to option first is that are you to get
back to your country if you are
accepting that particular thing then
there is just cut the hole so anyhow
nothing will happen because that was the
protocol or that is the kind of us came
so you don't need to leave the country
now in second option they will ask to
that you know to pay 650 or
on euros or any amount and then the
there is just there in that particular
with you until you pay the particular
amount and mostly it will ask you to pay
that particular amount through Western
money or money gram or nearest post
office no they will tell you that you
need to pay this particular amount and
people from our department will come to
your place and will verify all the
details and they even are recording this
particular so the inputs are even they
can prove that the mistake that you did
during the immigration poem and it was
not on purpose so yeah Network head can
overthink they will tell you and then
they will ask you to pay around 650
euros or any amount to nearest postal or
Western Union or MoneyGram so they will
be there with you until you do the
payment so you don't need to do anything
over there you just need to either cut
the call or you just need to tell them
that I will contact em person will sort
out on my own way now if you cut the
pool without telling anything then they
will call you from different number or
from same number of within a 5 or 10
seconds so and they will just talk with
you politely or anything like that
so please aware about this particular
scam calls don't put yourself on trouble
if you are facing anything like this
just one thing you can do is that you
just need to contact the Indian society
over here and they will help you with
that particular thing now
if you are in ireland you might be
receiving this kind of a poll Mabel did
receive this kind of a poll and they are
just posting this particular thing on
Facebook whatsapp group and everywhere
to avail other people in even if you are
coming in Ireland like in this
particular September intake or in turn

the technical department sir for Windows
operating system we've got these effects
yes you're telling me that you come from
a department but you haven't told me the
company that you come from PC fix and
can you tell me how you could possibly
in any way find signals from my machine
on the internet for all the customers
are users registered version of Windows
operating system yes so as you one of
them that reason we are receiving those
errors from your computer into a
universal server and how did you get my
telephone number because we have the
contact details for the customers we use
as a registered version of Windows
operating system right and so you've
definitely got me have you sorry
you've definitely got my details yes
that's how we got your details and what
what if I tell you I only run an app
Apple Mac but you must be having a
Windows computer for sure why because we
are receiving those error signals and
that indicator I can't see how you can
because I own you I need to have a Mac I
have a little map by the way two bodies
and thanks
so you can't help me then
well that's 12 minutes of their time
I've messed up
so here's a wild story for you a few
weeks back i got an email from a guy
named kabir
okay that's actually not his real name
but that's what we're going to call him
for the sake of this video
you'll find out why a little later on
and his email
said i am an indian scammer and i scam
people saying i work for amazon
last night i talked to a lady whose son
passed away a week ago
i didn't want to scammer so i refused
but my boss said he would not let me go
if i don't scam her
i tried leaving the office forcefully
but he stopped me when i tried calling
the cops
he broke my phone and i scammed the lady
for 600
but i feel bad i can do anything to
repay her the money
i need your help and you thought you had
a bad day at the office
anyway i had no idea if this was legit
or if this was just some 14 year old kid
in georgia pulling my leg
so i said click this link to prove
you're in india
and this was a link that i created that
would grab his ip address if he clicked
on it
and to my surprise he did and it put him
right in the heart of india
[Music]
i thought okay this is interesting i
said maybe we can raise some money to
help that lady you scammed
who is she and he said her name was
carol or something like that
and i said well let's see what we could
do to help her i thought if kabir and i
could work together then maybe we could
raise some money and help this poor lady
out
but the way that i make money is by
exposing scams
he said do you want my whatsapp number
so then we started chatting we got to
know each other a little bit and how he
got into this line of work
he talked about how he wanted to be in
the air force but the system is
corrupted
he talked about how they pay the cops to
look the other way he said i want to
tell you why i am helping you i wanna
make my parents proud
and that's when it struck me that all
these scammers deep down inside have
some good in them
i know there is good in you we just
gotta pry it out of them
you were right about me so kabir starts
telling me how the scam works
scammers will buy email lists and blast
out a fake email to thousands of people
and the email is designed to look like
it's from amazon
it says the customer ordered a really
expensive item that's going to be
shipped to a random address in florida
the recipients of the email will think
that somebody has hacked their amazon
account and the email gives instructions
to cancel the order
by calling them up thank you for getting
connected to amazon customer service
decide john mayer how may i help you and
most people will just think that the
email is spam and deleted but there's
one demographic that falls for it nearly
every time
the elderly hi my name is sharon and i
got an
email stating that i had placed an order
and that it was being shipped to florida
the scammers will go on to tell the
victim that somebody is hacked into
their amazon account and they need to
apply a refund to their bank account
and if something got charged to you we
would be refunding you the money back as
well
and the way they tell the victim that
they're going to apply the refund is by
connecting to their computer
and having them run screen control
software like any desk
click support from the search bar and
type in
any desk any any desk
they then walk them through the process
which allows the scammer to see
and control their screen yeah right just
click on accept yeah click on accept
allow once they have access to the
computer they instruct the victim to log
into their bank account
go to your browser and log into your
online banking for the centros bank
and this may seem weird but the scammers
will groom and flirt with their victims
to keep them at ease
i literally tell you one thing i really
like
i really are like your voice how old are
you thank you
i am almost 74.
apparently seriously
and they will make the victim think that
they've issued a refund by making an
edit to the site's html
and they make the victim think that they
accidentally issued them too much
and that they need to zeld the scammers
back the difference or pay them in gift
cards so what you need to do mom you
just need to go and get three
ebay cards just write down i have to buy
three ebay cards
right and this happens every day it was
a remote access heist
costing them about twenty five thousand
dollars
so we thought maybe we could intercept
some of these calls before people lose
it all
so kabir began to send me the names of
victims who were in the process of being
scammed
but either we couldn't get their number
or we couldn't get them to pick up the
phone while they were being scammed
and sometimes they would pick it up
without knowing that we could hear them
on the phone with their banks
[Music]
we were too late and we realized that
what we were doing wasn't working we
weren't saving anybody and it was taking
up way too much time
so that's when i decided we needed to
play some offense and we needed to
enlist the help of an expert
someone who knows a thing or two about
taking it to indian scam centers
someone with some real technical
expertise
i'm talking about jim browning
if you don't know jim browning he
exposes scamming on his youtube channel
and he has over 3
million subscribers he's a technical
genius he knows how to get inside the
scammers computers and really shake
things up
and scammers fear him they look under
their beds at night for jim browning
i thought maybe just maybe he'd be able
to help us out
and to my surprise jim said yes so
jim asked if there was any way that
kabir could plant a file on one of the
computers in the call center
the file would run quietly in the
background of the computer and give jim
total access and allow
us to see what they were doing this way
we could possibly collect customer
information more quickly
and warn the victims but only if kabir
was comfortable with this
it was a crazy plan but kabir agreed
so we had to think of a cleanest way to
install this file a flash drive would
draw too much attention and so we needed
to provide kabir
a link where he could simply download
the file kabir could then
find an opportunity when an agent was
away sit at his computer
click the link run the software and then
get the heck out of there before he got
caught
this is jason bourne type of stuff so
kabir waited for the perfect opportunity
to strike
we just left it up to him for when he
felt comfortable
and within a few days he sent me this
text
come online fast i said what
two minutes will be installed and i
thought holy crap it's really happening
oh my god okay it's happening but then
he sent me another text tell him to
accept
then he sent me a picture of the screen
and kabir didn't have permission to
download the file
jim had forgotten to grant him access
kabir said send with permission bro i
don't want them to suspect
crap i said i gotta get a hold of jim
please
make it fast i thought this can't be
happening so i start messaging jim
but he's away from his computer i said
i'm trying i don't know where he is
tell him to make it fast i said how much
longer can you hold
i don't know how long will it take i
don't know he isn't responding
bro call him please
[Music]
i said if we need to abort we can i
don't want to abort i need to get out of
this
and just when we were about to abort the
mission jim appears online
jim finally grants permission and the
file downloads and kabir gets the heck
out of there soon enough
jim then tells me he's got a connection
he can see everything they're seeing
he has their ip address he can see the
contents of their hard drive
the operation was a success you're crazy
she did kabir said don't tell them to
type anything
just watch they are live and getting
calls
it's an agent's computer tell them to
watch them scam
for now so we said okay and for several
hours jim and i just watched to
understand how the scam worked
calls would come in and scammers would
attempt to remote into their computers
to give them a refund
luckily today most of the callers would
just get suspicious and hang out
i thought well what if we called them up
and put some fear into them
we were now in their system but we
didn't know the phone number for the
computer that people were calling into
but we did know the phone numbers of the
victims calling in
so i just decided to call one of them up
and ask them for it
you happen to have that number just so i
can i can take it we do
yeah it's a 1-800 number okay
1-800-920-3333
okay that's helpful thanks so much okay
now we could call up the agent using
this computer but i thought that's not
really my specialty
i don't do that i should get someone who
actually does this for a living
and i thought of pierogi from scammer
payback hi
um i'm calling regards to you all
reaching out about a 400
order pierogi is an amazing scam baiter
and he does it all day
every day on twitch and youtube so jim
and i reached out to him and he agreed
to come on board
we thought let's just call them up and
test the waters a bit sir
on your computer do you have a browser
called google chrome
i do how did you know that
every windows computer has google chrome
sir oh
okay i always heard that google chrome's
had more viruses on it
but i i might be wrong okay it depends
it depends on the kind of websites you
visit on that browser oh
well i don't i don't visit those types
of websites if you know what i mean
i know you might son but not me i might
get plenty of action
yes i'm on my googles so we eventually
just hung up we didn't want to do
anything too crazy we thought
things need to calm down a little bit
over there we would try again later
but later never came when the day ended
the computer shut down and they never
came back on
and we wondered what happened so i
checked in with kabir i said
do you have any information on what's
going on in that center he said yes
nothing big will be solved tonight and i
said
what do you mean are they having
technical problems yes but nothing big
so no scamming tonight yes
give me an hour so apparently they're
having some technical issues an hour
came and went and we still saw no
connection
in fact nearly a week came and went and
we still saw no connection
what was going on and then i got this
text
bro they know they think i was the one
who has the remote
what they found the software that's
impossible i said
i'm confused you in trouble
and i didn't hear from him for like a
few hours
until later that day when i decided to
check in on him again
he said con hey too
okay why is he talking in hindi to me i
take this over to google translate and
it reads
who are you that's when it hit me
this wasn't kabir then he starts calling
me
but i don't dare answer he texts me
again in hindi if you do not get the
call then find your friend in the yamuna
river
holy crap they've kidnapped him and
stole his phone and they start calling
me again
and again more texts come in
are you from the crime branch morehindi
then he starts speaking english your spy
is with me
what is the software in my computer my
technical team said it is not good that
you are watching my computer
oh my gosh they have found the software
what is the software what information do
you have
my center is closed for six days
well now we know why they went quiet for
a week they were restoring all of their
computers and removing the software
you spoil my business for six days
and finally i said good then you
couldn't rob little old ladies
he said now who will pay your friend
so this taunting just went on and on and
eventually
i just had to block him i mean i wasn't
going to negotiate with a criminal and i
couldn't stick around to watch what was
going to happen next
i was really scared i thought i had
finally gone too
far i knew this was risky and i
shouldn't have let kabir do this
and this bothered me for several days i
even reached out to a friend in india
who is a lawyer to see if law
enforcement might want to get involved
but he didn't think that the police
would take something like this seriously
and it certainly doesn't help that the
cops are in the pockets of these
scammers and they're literally paid to
look the other way
and so i just kind of told jim that the
story was over
and i really didn't know what to do next
then a couple of days later i get a text
on whatsapp from an unknown number
send me the link now
[Music]
i thought is this kabir nobody else knew
about the link but i
tried to play dumb i said what link
shut up and send me the link they are
all out of town
only some are here all the foolish ones
send me the link
okay it was kabir turns out that they
roughed him up and left him somewhere
away from the call center but somehow
kabir managed to get remote access to
his boss's laptop
and now he wanted to give me access so
i said okay whatever and i sent him
jim's link and i said this is
dangerous shut up i ain't going nowhere
without this
job done holy crap this guy wants to go
down
in a blaze of glory so i checked in with
jim and sure enough
there was a connection jim traced the
coordinates and it was the same call
center that we had already bugged
and he could see the screen and indeed
it was the boss's computer
we had access to all his files and we
found call lists
his id cards recordings of all their
scams
my husband just noticed an email
yeah we could see him routing the calls
to the different agents and more
importantly
we could see him converting the gift
cards that they were stealing
to bitcoin through a website called
paxful
and he had a whatsapp window open where
the agents would send him the gift cards
and kabir said you can steal the cards
and make that yours
steal the card numbers and take all
don't let this [ __ ] earn
this is insane i said why are you doing
this
he said when you start to see the end
everyone wants to go to heaven
okay so we thought if we could grab
these gift card numbers and redeem
them before the scammers did we could
possibly get them refunded
and returned to the victims but the
scammers were too quick at redeeming
them
jim then suggested that we show this
evidence to paxful's team
they don't tolerate scamming or money
laundering and they would surely shut
down the account if we provided enough
evidence
so jim hit the record button capturing
everything they were doing in perfect
detail
but we had to hold them off in the
meantime they were robbing people in
front of our very eyes
so when they got bitcoin in their
account from a gift card exchange
we quickly added a different wallet id
so when they went to transfer the funds
they sent it to us instead
and that got them spooked but they
started scratching their heads over what
had just happened
and soon they realized that their call
center had been bugged again
and they immediately began to shut down
their operation and of course
reset all of their computers for the
second time in a month
soon our connection was lost and just as
kabir predicted
all eyes were now on him i need to go
i am sorry
then he sent me a screenshot of his boss
freaking out asking where he was
but khabir just ignored him and i said
go where
before they come i am gonna set myself
free and yes tell my friend i am sorry
for all the troubles he faced
his name is tell him i love him
and all i did was to prove that i am not
a sinner
once he asked me what in life are we
gonna do by scamming
tell him he still has time to quit
[Music]
what are you gonna do i'm gonna quit i'm
done
where are you going don't know
[Music]
this is my story
[Music]
soon enough jim did get word from
paxwell that the account was suspended
and the user was now under investigation
you can learn more about what jim
uncovered by checking out his channel
i will link to it in the description of
this video
i want to thank him for the chance to
team up on this he is as kind as he is
brilliant
and i also want to thank pierogi from
scammer payback for the laughs
check out his channel where he's making
big steps to stop scammers
and help victims and most importantly
i want to thank kabir who is still
around and still in touch with me
him and i have a lot of things planned
to make more people aware of these types
of scams
i really hope that you look for the good
in people because everybody has some in
them
and it's not too late to change who you
are or fix what you've done
kabir story is proof of that and i also
hope that you warn the elderly people in
your life to hang up
when they get phone calls telling them
their amazon account has been hacked
awareness is how we're going to put
scammers like this out of business
so how about sharing this video with a
friend i want to thank you all for
watching and for all of your support
be sure to subscribe for more exciting
adventures like this
and i will see you on the next one
now sam now is going to launch csa and xuxa
what time
what football history to spend
the commander know what which admitted
fraud to the law of god mother of art and art
cetkovska think as soon as possible
well it's called the Social Security
scam and like the IRS scam it has become
an epidemic with millions of Skol phone
cell phones targeted and I should say
consumer reporter John Matarese here of
course with one local victims story
would you find out John
well Tonya a brave Blue Ash mom she lost
thousands of dollars to this scam she
actually agreed to share her story with
us about how threatening and convincing
these colors can be it was late one
morning when an cell phone rang somebody
called me and a voice like this one
turned her world upside down and as a
mother of three from Blue Ash who agreed
to an interview only if we changed her
name he said I had 25 bank accounts I
had illegal drug activity I'm was ma you
know I warned out for my lust for money
laundering the agent told her to follow
his instructions or she was going to
jail I needed to prove that I only have
two bank accounts not 25 the caller told
her to empty her account and forward the
money to the government for temporary
safekeeping all I could think about was
I'm gonna go to jail I have these kids
you know I had my kids at home with me
how believable was this guy who's very
believable she withdrew almost all her
"life savings I emptied $20,000 out of my"
bank account when the teller questioned
her are you taking the money out for and
I lied and told him furniture the caller
was so threatening she ignored her own
daughter and my 13 year old she was like
mom that's a lot of money why are you
taking all that money out the caller
then wanted her to transfer the money
via gift cards and what's become a
classic scam now these scammers were
very sophisticated and knew exactly what
they were doing rather than have an go
to one store and purchase over 10 grand
in gift cards they had her go to
multiple targets and make multiple
purchases so she bought batches of $900
gift cards and no store clerk stopped
her and they hardly asked me any
questions after 20 grand of gift card
purchases the agent asked for the
numbers he had me read every single
number and he was like okay well you can
go home now with the caller finally off
the
phone and realized she'd been scammed
she called police but the money was
already gone
Tracy Lynch of the u.s. inspector
general's office says agencies are
receiving thousands of complaints about
these calls one we see that's very
common is that your social security
number has been flagged for suspicious
activity
she says you must know Social Security
the IRS and FBI will never call to say a
warrant is out for your arrest no agency
will ever demand you wire them money or
purchase gift cards and that wants
others to see how easy it is to fall for
this because I I was really in a
different eye I wasn't myself I was
tough you know it's so brave of her to
actually be willing to talk about it
most people would be I've heard from
others but they're too embarrassed to go
on TV thank you for coming forward and
letting everyone it's wonderful that
she's willing to share that story now
target tells me it cannot refund her
money saying we have signs in our stores
to warn customers and we share safety
tips with our team members through
training but Tonya obviously that
training did not help this time
check later

fix the problem itself but if it was
able to fix the problem it it give you
the number of online available tuition
all right because I wanted to run a
computer result and have it needs
immediate attention this is the reason
why you got the number on the screen
right away tell me what is the basic
usage of your computer what you do on
this computer beeping I browse the web I
check my email accounts and do not
understand do you go to get your
Facebook email online banking go
shopping on this computer yes I do that
as this might be the security threat
I'll amend you the doors use any kind of
online banking or financial work of this
company to manage them I mean this
problem is fixed all right
so but do you have any idea what kind of
security or what kind of protection
you're using on this computer
like what means if together do you have
of this computer Microsoft for no
Windows Defender Windows Defender
Windows Defender is the basic security
oh do you have any other security apart
from that no algebra tiles any Windows
Defender is the basic security like
whenever you purchase any computer you
get net with the computer itself alright
but you but you need a security which we
can protect your computer from these
kind of things let me just check if you
were here system and security Windows
Firewall is the inbuilt security that
you got with the computer but then
cannot give you a complete protection
and I can see here there is no security
is no protection of computers is the
main reason so that tell me are you the
primary user on this computer or
somebody else also use this computer
apart from you know bun the only user
that uses this computer you don't
usually
when did you operate your computer to
Windows 10 I think there was a card like
four days ago and that thing goes on the
3029 for some more difficulty yeah I was
on the 29th I've done it ok got it
I can just check some other things you
just alright so what you do basically
like how old are you I'm 21
what do you want yeah you wanna students
yeah okay I won't look on your screen I
have cigarettes more than it more than
400 hazards and warning on your computer
be net then it is not good for your
computer
I see those errors yet other one of
those you could have really damaged a
good check you on the date and the time
when they are getting you okay so what
does that mean I I will tell you these
might be the corruption you're getting
on your computer whenever you complete a
face any problem or any application on
your computer fees any problem it makes
a log of that and you get it for 400 and
in ever the morning and when you try to
sign to meet any one of them there is an
option of delete it should be removed
using advanced to are those of viruses
have you ever then remember when was the
last time you did a celery so you need
you need a cleanup on your computer by
any technician I haven't done that no
those viruses though that you saw those
are not exactly the virus this might be
the you know corrupt corrupted files for
applications that you get them but these
things get into the operating system you
got Windows 10 which is the latest
operating system in the market for a
very good computer you have to just take
care of your computer from these things
you can see over here this is system
configuration this is the brain of your
computer check the services have a look
on your screen a lot of services on your
computer are stopped in see stop stop
yeah that is it's supposed to be on a
Rina understand they're supposed to be
running did you stop these services on
your computer nobody then Microsoft
stopped them no it's it's all because of
the LS morning and house you know
unwanted stuff that you are getting on
your computer might be possible because
of that either stop let's see over here
there is always name the application
identity and you can see with the name
of this is the forest which identify
which application is good for your
computer and which is not and it is not
working here any higher third party
application or any on what is the
application and get into computer
without the permission
you know whenever you go online or
within any website at the back of the
website there might be some infected
files or corrupted files present over
there and they might get into your
computer if you know
drop what security images what happened
here because you know internet is very
much polluted these days so you have to
have a security at your computer so that
whenever you go online any unwanted
stuff won't be able to get into your
computer right and on let me just check
one more thing here tell me is the only
computer you have in your network like
in your house or do you have any -
computer connected here I have other
computers yes how many computers you
have apart from this computer to to one
of you

network so they might be an interior of
the computer as well because all the all
the three computers they are in the
theme network they are in your house and
they're the next into Internet wire a
local ad network of your house why the
network they might see - level to hear

that's in there block list control a
coffee I'm going to just change this to
HTTP I'm going to click enter and then I
get your guys's number right over the
page are you guys doing this to everyone
does this looks like a screenshot of
Microsoft Security Essentials can I show
you one more thing can I show you one
more thing I have a youtube account
alright and your video I go around to
people to try to lie about computers see
and your video is going to be uploaded
to this channel along with all the other
companies that help do these type of
scams and I will be posting that on
YouTube and uploading it as I am
recording this and I'm going to go back
to the malwarebytes website for you one
more time
all right
I'm going to be a contact into law
enforcement because you guys have lied
about my computer question one question
sir why are you causing it again because
we are trying to educate the public
through my videos on YouTube so people
that don't know much about computers
especially the senior citizens around
that will believe what your guys are
going to say so they don't get ripped
off so why do you guys do this you're
ripping people off so first of all I'm
repeating one thing again and again
Sophia yeah you guys all right you guys
have created a pop-up that said that I
have frets on the computer you realize
this is a fresh install of Windows 10
there's nothing on here it's clean of
soap okay first of all sir I'm telling
you again and again you have cured me
and everything right or should me mother
by society I showed me all those icons
all the URL but I can also say that you
are you might be a scammer right yes
Stan were you trying to get me to pay
499 bucks for services on a computer
that's claim you want to give miss a
call for home I didn't tell you to give
me a call back
nope but you guys are making pop-ups
that are online and the frets don't
exist on the computer you know that
where that pop up this bogus the frets
in that pop up do not exist if you guys
are making up scare tactics to scare
users to think in their computer has
problems
sir first of all we do not see anything
lied to the customer we showed the
problem which you guys have though the
the Event Viewer err our standard
windows logs nothing but these are the
printouts would have been taken by you
only the other words are off the
malwarebytes site as you see here to go
up to the screenshot section there
they're all on here this is how I got
them tricks used by scammers and they're
logged in over the remote desktop they
will try to trick you and saying errors
or viruses on the computer and these are
just different tactics that you people
like to use right I'll show you the one
I had you are showing anything for the
punim oh okay well I'm sorry if I called
you the scammer but are you I want to
know how do you guys promote your
business or you've taught to do this by
someone higher up because perhaps the
company you're working for is getting
you to scam and you're not knowing it
because that you do you do have to look
at this as a very professional security
website do you know that yes it's a
security site it's a very popular
security site I don't know if you know
about these maybe you just are working
for people that are that are trying to
get you to scam or do you like have like
some kind of book that you're reading
off of or some kind of log when you go
into the customers computer that you
were told to do this or something maybe
don't know yeah do you want to know I
think so
good doesn't matter because it's a good
thing each and everything has to be got
it right
you do get it this is a fresh install of
Windows 10
how can a virus be on a formatted hard
drive that I format it in the installed
Windows 10 whenever you have a problem
on your computer
it isn't manage be using a Windows 10 it
will automatically come to your
computers here if you aren't that much
of good knowledge about the computers I
know yeah I'm talking to someone right
now yeah what was that why you deleting
them I'm not I'm not touching you
compute 11 you are doing whatever you
want to well you're not gonna know what
I'm doing with my money I'm gonna have
to end the call now all right stop
ripping people off we're uploading this
to YouTube your video will be along with

local atrophy that is 192.168 stop - 4.1
feature to do that yep 1080 the IP
address this is an IP address that's a
computer which will older than always
remain the same Toula finds you got to

same but the problem which you got into
computer that is the default average if
you can have a look over here these are
the foreign address is down at the
bottom which you got and if I'll talk
about this to a 5.25 really 5.40 so this
IP address is from mexico young so let

your customer this call is in regards
for the renewal of your computer
services
hi my name is kevin martin from firewall
computer security service
we're gonna refund the money to you okay
that's
500 how long your bank is open
um it's open till eight raj will i be
able to get the cash out and put it into
the box and send it like i did the other
time
with the aluminum foil and everything
yeah you can do that
okay i'll tell you the address tomorrow
they're trying to intercept the package
right now who is
the scammer this guy's giving us his
real name and real address
and we have this llc and everything what
they're trying to do is
have it drop somewhere else they're
trying to get it changed so it's being
held at like the ups store or something
and then
that's what they're doing now and then
they're going and picking it up
what up suckers we're doing it we're
gonna try something different
this time i think that'll be better than
trying to get him to come outside
because yeah we're gonna be like
neighbors knocking on the door and like
hey i just got my package and i saw your
package you know you just kind of okay
go grab your package
calling me or something me off the hook
like i need this information and all
this stuff
because they're 100 trying to reroute it
so i don't know if they're
spooked or whatever it was supposed to
be uh 40 000
but he changed it to the first package
supposed to be ten thousand
that was the first shipment so they're
looking for ten thousand today ten
thousand dollars
he just created an llc in april to
launder money
they call it did you put um tape on the
box anything like that stands out just
in case
it doesn't give you guys a photo holding
it down will turn it
on and off so it's off right now the
lens is right here in the center
both sides look the same but the left
side is a button so you're just gonna
if there's no lights on just hold it
down for it we'll do this we'll do it
yeah
we're gonna do it essentially blinking
means recording yeah
it's blinking it's recording now and
we'll just leave it on
you look like a cyborg
like i just pushed it once mm-hmm see
everyone inside it's not recording it's
not recording okay so it has to be just
make sure
it's blinking if for any reason they
fall off or whatever just before you put
them on make sure they're recording
and then i'll just turn them on so this
is what the building looks like
it's really nice actually yeah it's
really
do you see with scammers leaves that's
where we're going
there's a fountain out front there's
like a yeah on a corner
find a way to get him
oh there's three russian terminers
wearing 1998 oakley's that i don't know
what's going on
maybe we can go into the lobby or
something and ask about apartments
we can't get them outside and we can't
get inside without being questioned
what are we gonna do yo no matter what
we've got to get him outside yeah that's
the only way it works
there's no plan b even if you go to the
office a lot of places wouldn't give
tours on the spot you have to make an
appointment
especially right now wondering if maybe
we should make an appointment
while we're driving now for later just
in case
because then if everything else fails we
can't get in the building
say we have a a 12 30 appointment i can
just walk in and say hey my name's
ashton
uh i have an appointment yeah but dude
i have to because they're gonna take my
id that's true you know that's the other
thing even if we get in the building all
goes great he might not even answer the
floor
because they don't get packages
delivered to their doors so if there's a
delivery guy at his door
he's not gonna he may not answer it you
know if he's smart
which he's probably not says they do
self-guided tours
so
hi my name is ashton um i am looking at
places in the area
uh to relocate um i see on your website
that you offer self-guided
tours is there uh do you have to make an
appointment for that or how does that
work
as well so we can definitely show you
around okay
appointment for um uh were you looking
to stop by today tomorrow
today would be great are you flexible
with the time like could i give you like
a window like if i'm going to be there
between like
you know i don't know 11 and 1 or
something yeah
who is coming to your house i mean i'm
not really lying i really want to see
the place
you're not here to waste your time no
let him show us around or do whatever he
wants to do and then
say hey can we just have a few moments
to do self guiding so we can talk about
it
and then we can go to the door and see
what happens that could be like a worst
case scenario
i think you should do that anyways dude
i think you should totally
do the tour anyways art can just be like
hey dude
uh is your name i think they've
delivered your box to my
thing or something yeah you know what
i'm saying and you're just a neighbor
you wouldn't even need it you're just
his neighbor bro you wouldn't even need
a box you can just walk up to the door
and say hey i grabbed my packages
there's one with your name on it
is this for you and just kind of like
refer to down the hallway even though
it's not really there
oh but we're just as bad as the scammers
because we lied about a phone charger a
chapstick
right yeah i know we have a break uh if
we go
in together as uh potential customers i
don't think we should both be wearing
classes yeah because we look like two
terminators they're like ready to
conquer that freaking dog so maybe you
wear the glasses and i will just use my
phone because if i'm actually there
looking for an apartment i would be
taking pictures
good
[Music]
um
[Music]
[Music]
he's on the no parking spot when there
is a spot right next to him
maybe right there oh you can't get in i
didn't see there was a gate my fault
well then what is the ultimate goal then
just answer the door do you see his face
that's it well what else are we going to
what do you want to do we want to mud
wrestle him like
oh here maybe over here oh wait don't i
think this is the same
guest oh my god it's a pet spa
yes parking lot yeah all right we'll
just hang out then i guess until someone
knows
when we get to the door me and brandon
will go out of view a little bit just
down
like you know 15 feet away from the door
so if he looks at the peephole he just
sees you knock on the door hopefully
he'll open it
but he might say who is it either way
you're gonna say hey i live down the
hall and i have a package for you
right uh it was put in my box or
something then we're just gonna talk to
him as long as we can until he shuts the
door in our face
give something that like look i have
your box it's got drop off by at my unit
by accident come get it
walk with him and give him package and
confront him
[Music]
i don't know
i have zero service really no service
so our list is almost over we have to
give them notice in um
yeah that's fine appreciate it
[Music]
this pool is amazing
[Music]

come back and take a look out there i'll
show you everything
yeah more welcome you do that so i'm
here until six so i'm not going anywhere
so if you got any questions
or we can't come back we can't spend the
time yeah talk about it yeah if you
wanna discuss
okay
uh first week of september will be on
the fourth floor they're still occupied
so i'm not even sure
which
sorry
next one
again
now with the fox um you have to scan on
the inside
uh and get in from the garage doors and
the cabinet box closer everything is
absolutely so so i have no interest
all right
[Music]
foreign
so
so this level here
so this area here
and then i got one more level to show
you up here wow
deliberate and stuff um
um there was like a little seating area
on the second floor yeah
um is there a way we can just sit there
and talk for a little bit like yeah
i really liked that view i just wanted
to
[Music]
thank you so much we'll see you in the
office uh as you know you need to
you'll need me to get back down to the
elevator so how long how long do you
need
um i don't know just uh two minutes yeah
so we we're limited with where we can
like just explode
yeah do you want to do yeah that's fine
if we're if we're done early can we just
come to the office and meet you uh
you'll need me to get that down to the
elevator
but i'll be able to see you from the
leasing office okay so i'll be on the
lookout so just wait
gotcha okay now come out and say i'll
come up again okay perfect
you so much
um we saw the guy yeah
we saw the guy in pink t-shirts yeah
there's a stairwell i saw a stairwell
over there
but it's probably the same yeah
okay
we missed that opportunity i didn't yet
know
that we would be uh restricted
on going back there i thought this was
the perfect plan
see anything we do in front of him
like
[Music]
all right
talk to the guy to this guy and say look
look she says who we are
we're looking for his camera and camera
live in this place can you
you know explain him what's up i know
it's tricky but he's not gonna
take us to the door there's no way
that's why it's plenty
yeah perfect thank you
awesome thank you thank you so much for
your time really appreciate it
fudge
actually i saw in the garage i don't
know about here
okay you see there is another way to get
in but
boom that's um that's stairs
those are stairs yeah those are stairs
but again i can
we can get on the second floor and it's
one more thing
to accomplish and is that um
that that key fob yeah once you start
asking questions he's already busted
right boom
stairs yeah and he's walking up to the
stairs
but you need a fab to get in the stairs
too huh yeah well
no not here not here oh maybe you need
one to get
in but when you approach second floor
you need i i i truly yeah that's gonna
be the same situation
so i'll see you i have no service what a
[ __ ]
i got nothing yeah dude as soon as i
texted you
we walked by and the guy's door open and
i was like no
i worried one of you be like that was
him like what
that's why i kind of like stopped and
turned around and i was i was so close
because i was about to be like oh my
back hurts
let me stop for a second and like kind
of delay it but it just didn't it didn't
feel right or whatever it didn't feel
right it didn't feel like it was a 100
percent the right decision right here
and i didn't want to [ __ ] it up right
there that's good then no i didn't do it
it's okay but
yeah i'm gonna check the stairs
[Music]
yeah that's what i thought you need a
key fob
to get on the second floor you need keep
up to get into the building
so two clicks i can go outside and um
i can walk outside and get this service
okay
we'll i'll keep an eye here and for
anyone okay are you texting anything to
you
should i text him something i was just
asking if he got the number yet
tell him why
never gonna win
so
okay two things that doesn't make sense
i can swear right now
that ups just put this box with this big
red
um orange thing over there yeah in um
in a locker in a locker but uh scammer
payback texted us and he said they just
texted me and said no cash in the box
which doesn't make sense because i saw
ex like are you sure i was
looking at ups guy and he had this size
box
with um orange on the side so either the
bluffing
that might be a traditional ups label
though
so could have been another one
but i need to go girls because like i
would not know what he's saying because
all right
just go go do what you gotta do i'm
gonna call him and tell him what's up
hey brother okay listen the situation is
very
uh tricky over here the building is so
protected we did a tour
maybe he's blocking because i swear
i swear that i saw um
i saw you ups guy uh putting right now
with the red with the orange tape
putting back the uh package right now in
a box
maybe they're bluffing okay we will
figure out okay but that's what are
happening right now
okay um i swear ups guy put
bugs that belongs to us um he just
brought more boxes
and on the rest of the boxes there is no
orange stage
it was orange tape it was exactly like
this and i was looking on a pierogi
picture and he was holding like this
and i got closer and i see orange tape
across exactly the same
and he opened and put in the locker and
i received text message from pierogi uh
texas pierogi and said why would you do
this there is no cash why are you lying
and i said pierogi play alone maybe he's
bluffing because i saw the box i was
like i might be wrong
and i explained him situation that uh
everything is protected with a key fob
and we're trying to weasel ourselves to
the second floor to at least talk to the
guy
even if he got the package [ __ ] it
doesn't matter package is irrelevant
right now right
but there is a huge possibility what i
feel that that
can right now show up i'm out come out
here come on
picture dude walk out any moment now
yeah yeah but he specifically had a pink
shirt on
yeah no i saw it yeah half hour ago and
i saw this locker room
um the bugs got dropped also and
nobody's picked it up since
no no because i was like they're closing
it from you i can see it from here all
right
so we have two options right now either
you know again maybe they're bluffing
and they're just trying to see if he's
for real or not
is that him behind me that's him that's
him
i told you yeah that's him let's do it
let's go let's do it
[Applause]
we're going to get this

come on how much how much you're getting
by picking up these packages and sending
to your boss
yeah i sent this package to someone no
that is in india yeah so you take the
package here and you send it to india
right
laundering it overseas yeah
laundering the money overseas to the
indian call centers that are posing as
refund department right yeah think
but how do you take this money do you

i don't know if i believe that their
call centers they pretend to be
microsoft
mary swanson was the one who sent that
box and she was caught up in a refund
scam
thankfully we're here to intercept it
but they make her think that they put
like thirty thousand forty thousand
dollars into her account
they edit the html of the page and then
they tell her you gotta send us that
money back
so put a cash in a box and send it to
addresses to your front door
and why it's just that it's in the box
and i said
it seems like doing really well if you
can afford to live in this apartment

seven four thousand dollars

WE'RE STAYING ON TOP OF THE
LATEST SCAMS AND THE NEWEST ONE
TO HIT YOUR PHONE COULD GET YOU
IN TROUBLE JUST FOR SAYING THE
"WORD ""YES."""
HOW IT WORKS IN THIS 7 NEWS
CONSUMER WATCH.
Reporter: WELCOME TO A NEW
LEVEL OF SCAM CALLED DECEPTION.
IT STARTS INDEPENDENTLY ENOUGH
WHEN YOU PICK UP A NUMBER YOU
DON'T -- INNOCENTLY ENOUGH WHEN
YOU PICK UP A NUMBER YOU DON'T
RECOGNIZE LIKE AMY OWENS DID.
AND SOMEONE SAID YOU'RE THERE
AND I SAID WAIT A SECOND MY HEAD
SET'S MESSING UP AND I PAUSED
AND SHE CAME BACK ON AND STARTED
SPEAKING VERY QUICKLY ABOUT A
"SPECIAL THAT THEY WERE HAVING,"
OR SOMETHING THEY WANTED TO SELL
ME.
Reporter: AT SOME POINT THE
CALLER ASKS IF YOU CAN HEAR
THEM.
AND I SAID YES.
ONE SIMPLE WORD THAT CAN BE USED
AGAINST YOU.
REPORTS TO POLICE AND THE BETTER
BUSINESS BUREAU ACROSS THE
COUNTRY SHOW THE SCAM ARTISTS
RECORD AND YOU MAY USE YOUR
AFFIRMATIVE ANSWER AS PROOF THAT
YOU SIGNED UP FOR A SERVICE LIKE
HOME SECURITY OR A CRUISE LINE.
WE DON'T ADVISE PEOPLE TO
CARRY ON THE CONVERSATION WITH
"THEM, IN THE EVENT THEY ARE"
"RECORDING YOUR CHOICE, YOU KNOW"
THEY MAY BE USING YOUR RECORDING
FOR FRAUDULENT CHARGES OR
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
SO IT'S NOT -- THE BEST THING DO
IS JUST TO HANG UP.
THE BBB ADDS EVEN IF YOU'RE
ASKED A SIMILAR QUESTION OR TO
PRESS A BUTTON TO BE PLACED ON
"THE DO NOT CALL REGISTRY, DON'T"
DO IT.
SAYING ANYTHING OR PRESSING THAT
BUTTON MAY HELP SCAM ARTISTS
IDENTIFY WHICH NUMBERS ARE
ACTIVE.
Reporter: KEEP IN MIND IT'S
EASY TO MANIPULATE THE PHONE
NUMBER.
"IF YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE IT, LET"
IT GO TO VOICEMAIL.
OWENS PLANS TO REPORT IT THE
"TO FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION, THE"
BEST WAY TO SHUT DOWN THESE
ILLEGAL SALES TACTIC.
IT'S A TOTAL INVASION OF
PRIVACY THE.
THE CALLER MAY HAVE YOUR
CREDIT CARD AND IS USING THE
CALL TO GIVE PERMISSION TO
AUTHORIZED CHARGES.
I'm here outside another scam call center
"This is Faremart travels Private Limited in Sector 18 gurugram, Haryana"
They have a legitimate travel company in the front building and then behind they have their call center hidden in another building
and these guys this call is just absolutely shocking. You're gonna hear. They're scamming a 13-year-old
Schoolgirl and you can hear the fear in her voice and that moment is going to hit you really really hard.
It's very hard to watch but this is the best example I've ever heard of the moralless scum that work in these call centers
These creeps should be in Tihar Jail
Support you are speaking with any how I can assist you? My computer came up with this security warning
"Okay, what does it says, the security warning you are getting."
"it says,"
"It says call us immediately at the phone number that I'm calling at, do not ignore the critical alert."
you're
If you close your computer access
Will prevent further damage to our network?
No problem. Could you please tell me what were you doing on your computer when you got this message?
I was downloading a game
"Okay, you were downloading a game"
"So, could you please tell me which game you were trying to download when this came up?"
Hang on mom i am trying to do something.
"It's called cooking simulator, okay. All right, so you dont need to worry"
I'll go ahead and diagnose each and everything for you and
I'll let you know what exactly the problem is going on and I'll fix that failure. Okay?
Thank you. My pleasure. So I will gonna tell you some instructions which you need to follow
So I want you to have a look on your keyboard
yes
click on yes
"yes, click on run now"
"no no miss, right now I'm just going to connect your screen to our secure servers, i'll diagnose everything in front of you and"
"After that, I'll let you know what the problem is going on, right?"
"So you need to click on all the positive options like ok, yes, allow, continue"
So what do you see now? What does it say?
"yes, click on yes"
"Yes, Edward. Oh, yeah Edwards I would like to"
Join the session you have to click on yes
Ok
hang on
oh my god
What happened
My mouse keeps playing up.
Now look at your screen. My cursor is moving on your screen. Ok. Now we are connected
"You need to sit back and feel relax. Yeah, I'll go ahead and diagnose each and every thing for you"
"I'll let you know, Okay!"
Okay
So this is alert which you're getting
I believe it says your computer has allotted us that it has been infected with a
p**nographic spyware.
"The following information is being stolen-your facebook logins, credit card details"
Email account login and photos stored on this computer. So could you please tell me how old is this machine?
i got it at the start of this year and you are the only one who use this machine or anyone else uses this machine apart from you
its just me
Is this your personal computer your work computer?
"my personal computer, I use it for high school"
You are using it for your school
Yeah
"Okay, so you are a student or a teacher"
Student
"Okay, so what all activity you are doing on your computer?"
"I do research, I use Google, I use my notes sometimes I watch Netflix I play roblox"
and apart from that
"I just use it for research, okay. So now look at your screen, this is a brain part of your machine"
and here you can see there are a bunch of errors and warnings
"Yeah, there are lots of infection which is coming up and this is not good as I'm checking over here. You can see"
"It shows me too many files,"
too many files has been damaged today within a couple of hours or couple of minutes you can see this is not good
and apart from that as we can see
Mam it can be fixed. No problem. So over here you can see it's a system configuration
these all are the services which are manufactured by Microsoft Corporation and
Here we can see the status. It shows me some services are running
That's what occurs but some of our not running has been stopped somehow
You see that?
um hm
This is not good you can see these all the services are very important
"Your passwords and the other important information is not safe and secure which are login, which you're doing on this computer"
"Yeah, so that is not good"
So I need to run a security scan in order to check what exactly the problem is going on
"Okay, why you having this problem? All right"
okay
Yes
yes!
"So, let me just go ahead and run a security scan, okay, so please bear with me, all right!"
okay
Yes
"I believe you might be a watching television right? No, it's my sister."
Sorry!
"No, I'm getting the lots of background noise so that's what I'm asking might be"
"Like the television is on you're watching television, I believe"
its not my TV
"Then why I'm having the background noise, this is my sister watching stuff"
So that's your sister she is watching this stuff. Mm-hmm
But as I'm getting the noise like a sense might be she is talking with somebody else
"It's YouTube people talking, they talk to themselves on youtube"
"So right now the scan is going on, okay, we have to wait once it will be done I ll let you know. All right"
okay
Yes
"So miss I would like to suggest you one more important thing, like could you please tell me apart from this computer"
How many other devices do you have?
2
Sorry
2
"Okay, so now look at your screen the scan is done and have a look over here"
It says your IP address is compromised. Do you see that?
yes
Sorry
yes
And it says network security damage as we already have checked. This is not running
it says 78% computer is damaged and
it says install a network security because you do not have the security that is important one and as it says your IP address is
Compromised that is not good. I need to check the status of your IP address. Do you know what an IP address is?
No
Because you know as it has been established
They might get into any of your information and they might do whatever they want to do without your knowledge without your permission
"Even they might misuse your pictures, your videos and your other email information and your banking stuff"
So could you please tell me apart from this computer? How many other devices do you have?
2
"Two, but you can see over here somehow it says 19 are current connections"
Do you see that
um hm
"Right, it means right now the 19 devices are connected, at this point of time that"
is not good. So let me just go ahead and
just run a scan. It might take few minutes and after that I let you know
Okay
hmm
"So, I'm just initializing our scan in order to check please bear with me, okay"
"Miss could you please tell me, what like apart from your schoolwork. What other work you are doing on the computer"
I
I watch YouTube and I play Roblox.
and I play other games that are downloaded on my laptop
Mm-hmm
What else just that okay
I'm saying once your problem will fix then everything will be good to go there will be no problem for that. Okay? Hello you there?
sorry
"Right miss, these things can be fixed by these level five technicians ,engineer"
"Okay, I'll connect it with them. You don't need to be worried. Okay"
I am going to help you out in order to take care of this problem because this can be fixed by these engineers
and these technicians are available online
Okay
okay
"Yes, so that's the reason I'm making the diagnostic report for you"
So I am going to share the report with the technicians. You don't need to be worried for that now here you can see miss
the scan is done and
You can see all of your user name and the passwords of all your account which are login that are visible
Do you see that?
"Yeah, right"
And it says the security is unsafe. So let me tell you miss there are three options either you can get
the two year of
security
warranty and support or you can get five year of
security
Warranty and support or you can get the lifetime
Security
"Warranty and support, okay"
do I have to pay for this
All right miss there will be a one-time fee and the security will be transferable
So I have to do a security warning support
Right miss you need to get the security. So everything would be documented. You don't need to be worried. Okay?
so is this optional or do I have to
"I'm sorry, this is"
"does this have to be, umm optional"
See this is not the option means
Yeah
these are the optional either you can go for two years or you can go for
Five years or you can go for lifetime and that's totally up to you
sorry
"So just go ahead and talk to your mom and let me know I'm still connected with you, okay?"
just give me a minute
"Sure, no problem. Take your time. I'm still connected. Okay, once you are done with your mom, just let me know"
Okay
hello
Hello. Yes.
"umm my mom is here, she wants to talk to you"
Hi
"Yeah, hi miss, how are you doing today? Good! hey what's happened?"
"Sorry, it's come up with these security, security warranty support"
Right because right now she's having a problem due to the absence of the security
umm what i have to do about it
Take a deep breath doston (friends). I know how you're feeling after watching that video
"These are the types of people that Jim Browning and I want to protect you, your family and your children from"
so please go and check out Jim Browning's latest video
He has done a full investigation into the haryanvi owners of this call center

a 33 year old man who allegedly mentor
the young kingpin of the over 500 crore
rupees Mira Road call centre scam was
arrested on Sunday the police questioned
Jagdish Kanani a partner in a BPO
business in Haryana Plaza at Mira Road
about the functioning of the telephone
scamming cartel a top police officer
confirm the arrests and said it was a
major breakthrough in the case
as Kanani is the creator of phone frauds
and mentor of 23 year old Sadr Tucker
alias Shaggy we have information that
Kanani is the one who cracked the code
of making easy money by misusing
technology and playing on the fears of
people he had worked on us processes as
a call center employee and was familiar
with the operations that involve calling
up US citizens and exerting pressure on
them to repay their credit card dues a
police source said he added that Kanani
had made investments in call centers and
played a vital role in setting up fake
ones across the country with different
names
I yeah I got a phone call just now
saying that there was some some issue
with my Amazon account
[Music]
exurbs 64 gigabytes for 740 million
dollars is being ordered from your
Amazon account to cancel your order or
to connect with one of our customer
support representative please press 1 or
simply stay on the line please

thank you for teaching em from digit a
door talking attitude oh yeah I got a
phone call just now saying that there
was some some issue with my Amazon
account
yes someone from Dayton Ohio has ordered
an iPhone exile the Amazon account okay
and so you call you to control the order
oh wow yeah I didn't do that

read through that type of stuff to make
sure they don't like steal my data or
anything like that especially with
what's going on right now

language it's it's very hard to
understand sometimes

you

it's it's I can run the program now if

all right
and let me know what comes up on your
screen
it's asking for connect to session
can you see your ID number agendas
yes
animals for very vacation so that can I
connect you
yes it's eight four four
seven
for seven
seven two two six
okay it's eight four four seven four
seven two two six right yes
what comes up on your screen just let me
know I think
you've got me the wrong numbers you tell
me that number beginning
sir do you realize that I am in complete
control and I know this is a scam but I
ask you something sir why do you do this
aye sir no seriously I mean I really
buddy why do you do this
see the main thing is is because I'm not
going to let them connect to my computer
unfortunately those scams happen all the
time if you get a phone call that says
you're getting an iPhone from Amazon
that you didn't order or whatever it is
it's a scam if you get something like
that happening or they want to connect
to your computer because of that don't
do it don't fall for it maybe in the
future I'll try to do something where I
can have them connect to a computer but
I have to take many many precautions on
that so there's other channels out there
like Kipp boga or scammer payback if you
want to check that out that is a great
thing that you can do now what usually
happens for this scam if you didn't know
they'll try to connect to your computer
and then they will run some tests and
diagnostics which really is absolutely
nothing you can do it on your own and
then they'll type something out that
says oh my god you have hackers on your
computer and we need to get in there and
fix it it usually then ends up being a
tech support scam that sort of
transitions into sometimes it could take
the way of where they log in to your
bank account and things like that where
they're trying to give you a refund or
something like that where it could turn
into the refund scam but essentially
like I said if you get a phone call
where they said that your aunt Mazon
account has been compromised it is a
scam don't fall for it you can waste
time with them but when they try to
connect to your computer if you don't
have certain precautions in place they
can steal some data they can lock you
out and do a few other things so just be
careful out there that's the end of the
video make sure you subscribe and ring
the bell for notifications so you'll be
notified every time a new video is
uploaded and as always never drink and
drive always tip your drivers your
delivery drivers and your shoppers and
we'll see you next time
[Music]
Teli force this is one of the companies
that we know people working in are
people who have worked in there and they
were running the IRS the tax camp ooh
police just came past us also we're on
our way to a scam call center right now
and we're gonna do a food tour there
there are a number of shots where the
scammers come out and eat their food in
the morning once their shift ends they
get to work in these Eve directions and
the scam call center we're going to it's
called web all IT park here in celebrity
West then go and we know it's a scam
call center because we know people
working there we know the scripts that
they're running this IT pack has so many
scam postings and different rooms and
different awards it's a real hub to scam
posted to tear West bingo
so chelo let's go find out what's can
cool Center employees eat we're getting
close to the scam call center now and we
can see the workers walking to the
center and we came here last night to do
some research to see what's available
and nobody there would tell us that they
worked for the causing to just across
the road they all said they were in
logistics or they were delivery guys but
none of them were wearing an Amazon
t-shirt or a sweaty t-shirt like
delivery guys we're know none of them
had motorcycles so yeah you know where
they work right when they're right
outside this wibble 80 park and i can
see it now
Chella let's go and check out the food
available there and maybe meet some
people nah
let's see because they didn't really
want to stare last night we were told to
go and film somewhere else not at these
food joints outside the IT park
and so of course not everybody here
eating is a scammer but we do know that
scam course it doesn't running in this
itback okay so I'm gonna stop talking
about scammers now because we're right
around them right now
[Music]
so I'm here outside wibble IT park now
and as you can see outside the main gate
there's about 50 to 20 restaurants or
you can call them checks here and all
the call center employees are sitting in
and having their breakfast after they've
worked the night shift so let's go and
explore what kind of food is available
here for these guys
[Music]
so what food are you eating this morning
so that's your favorite food yeah nice
okay and how do you stay awake at night
you do that way yeah tea coffee just tea
honey to me to only take no water no bro
so what do you like to eat for breakfast
you just having a candy for breakfast
yeah no man everybody here is chicken
perotta
yeah Maggie samosas
I tell main gentleman and you're working
in weather like a park yes oh good job
which company ash are with scripts you
doing a banking job they'll take the
port or no no money not Kohl Center
yeah cool Center business now yeah yeah
all right so I've been chatting to
people from wiggle IT and what they love
here is chicken and roti it's very
famous yet then the omelets are great
and apparently the tea it's amazing
everywhere so I think this is a tech
plant this is what we should go and
train Anna it runs really friendly to
different answering my questions we're
just waiting for the food and actually
the two guys that I'm with they used to
work here in Whittle I teapot
that's how we know what's going on here
we still know people who are working
inside they're running scams grips on
forums
Thank You G we've got the chicken
paratha here and this is 40 rupees
you get three Parata and two big chunks
of chicken and potato is all here in
Benghazi
they put potato in everything hey this
potato in the biryani potato in the
curry I love that that is one thing I
really love about whispering garden the
paratha is its flaky and fresh it's
really good
Wow I can see why they eat this I nearly
coughed
oh yeah spiciest house well this is too
spicy 6:00 in the morning at 7 a.m. in
the morning man this is gonna wake you
up and get you really the cool people
the chicken is super fresh it's super
juicy chicken paratha 40 rupees you
gotta come here and try this guys so
we're doing a food tour what else should
we try what do you guys eat thing is
what you get out here is John man hey
and who are you talking to who's on the
phone your boyfriend or didn't him a
kiss from me lovely bye
the people are a little bit shocked to
see afar and ahead hurry a food to her
and I gotta say it again I got a whisper
it though not everybody here is a
scammer
but the a scam course is just operating
out of this IT budget and I can tell you
that most of these kids working at these
scam call centers don't want to be there
it's their last option and we're just
chatting to somebody who works here and
he said like he doesn't want to be doing
it and he got out of it as well because
they know what they're doing is wrong
right but sometimes they're forced to do
it and you'll see that in my interview
with my friends out of hand I
interviewed him he's working for centers
in West Bengal so you can check that out
and my scam calls
the playlist and to get these jobs in
these scam call centers you don't need
any qualifications that's the thing you
don't even need much English these are
just following a script which you can
memorize and imagine you're getting like
"20,000 rupees a month and you're"
uneducated and you look at someone who's
an engineer and they might be Guinea
twenty-five to thirty thousand rupees a
month and you're getting nearly the same
as them like it's an it's an amazing
deal for these business a lot of money
now the most popular dish at the store
here is the YY noodles or Maggi noodles
and the fried rice and it's mainly
because of the price it's probably the
cheapest thing you can get on the menu
here 20 rupees the let's try that now
they're making the why away right now
and it's not any type of why away is not
just noodles on tacit they put on all
sorts of stuff this tomato this onions
they can put in chicken if you want to
pay more they put an entire egg this is
a special noodle they really jazz it up
I guess you can say that enough can't
wait to try this this cows absolutely
everywhere here hello guy look at these
beautiful dishes these are just twenty
rupees each can you imagine that you'll
never get this stuff and this
presentation just livable and quality of
food anywhere else in India for 20
rupees I don't think so we've got why
why cooked with egg and extra spices and
extra vegetables chilies and everything
in there and then we've got this
beautiful fried rice with chutney as
well like and just blown away at the
price seriously 20 rupees why would you
cook at home you just eat here in the
morning for breakfast after you've
finished your your work at the call
centre it's amazing and it's a huge
plate like this is a lot of food for 20
rupees really blown away let's try it
now so why why is similar to mega
noodles okay not much difference except
they really spice it up and jazz it up
as you saw
incredible
it's whywe times 100 oh my god and
adding the ear unit if you pay an extra
10 or 20 rupees you can't have chicken
in a tube that would be if honestly this
plate is all you need for breakfast now
to the fried rice look at this I think
they've cooked it with saffron and some
term runs and it's chilly in there and I
think I'm kind of fried onion it's not
really a fried rice this is more like a
fellow I really like and fragrant pulao
think again like 20 rupees for all of
this
let's stop coming here for all my meals
sixty rupees three meals done one more
thing we've got tea ten rupees small cup
of tea it's full milk there's no water
in this it's just a hundred percent milk
that's why it's so creamy a little bit
of a light sea a little bit of ginger in
there as well and a bit too much sugar
for my liking but I know that people in
West Bengal loved things sweet they

What I want to do is I would like for
"you to see those errors, because once you see that"
it can give you all that your details of those errors.
Since these errors did not go and did not

"Sorry I just cancelled them all, I just got rid of them straight away."
"Ok, now look at your keyboard"
Yep

Oh yes

Now have you got eventviewer there
"Yes, yeah got that"
"Ok, so now let me explain what is event viewer"
Event viewer is a place which has been designed by Microsoft themselves
where they can see the reason of their software failure
and how many files of their software has been corrupted and how many are parts in good condition. Right.
Right yep.
"So, just confirm me"
what have you got on the left-hand side of the space? Of the event viewer
"Errr. It just says. Custom views, Logs, Applications, Services, Subscriptions"
Ok
Make a single left click on the Windows Logs
"Ok, yes"
"Now on the list are there Applications, Security, Setup, System?"
Yes I can see that
"Now we are going to check the application part of the software, alright"
"Ok, yes"
Now make another left click on Application
Yep got that
"Now have you got a list of Information, Information, Information?"
In the middle part of this list
Yeah theres loads in there.
"Ok now check it out, in the list of Information can you see any Red circle Errors or any Yellow triangle Warnings?"
Errr theres an awful lot in here.
Just scroll this page and check it out if there any Error or Warning
"Theres a huge section of them here, I've got pages full."
Ok scroll down the page
Theres loads there though
Can you just scroll down there to look through those Errors where you have list of Information. You see a scroller right?
"Yeah I got that, theres like hundreds of errors though."
Just check if you have more than five errors or less than five. Don't take an exact count of errors.
It will be in Red colours.
Theres at least 50 to 100 there!
Hundred Errors?
Yes Correct.
One moment Sir I want you to stop it right there.
Ok
"Let me tell you Sir, normally you don't get hundred errors right,"
at the moment since you see hundred errors it means
that one error is actually leading to all the rest of the errors that you get to see ok?
"Ok, yeah."
"Ok, let me tell you Sir the same problems"
you know ??? leading to all these problems.
At the moment you have either there were so many standards
"there were some errors, there were some damage done by these deadly malicious files, correct?"
Oh right ok
Applications on your computer alright?
Now that you have seen hundred errors let me tell you Sir
"if you ignore the problem anymore, let me tell you it is going to be dangerous"
and beleive me one day you might find your computer not working at all.
Oh really?
Yes Sir it has happened for us and to me and I have gone through those problems
"nobody can understand that better than me, alright."
Oh ok.
Anyway now I have shown you those errors Sir on your applications and if you have wreaked it
let me tell you any kind of error or damage thats done on the applications while working
can damage internally which you can't see
"But that, these place which you saw all those errors you will find all the error logs."
"Can I just check with you Sir, how old is this Computer?"
Its only about six months old.
Six months old?
Yes thats correct.
Do you have any other computer or laptop at home?
No its my only one.
Let me tell you Sir that the warranty on your computer is already lapsed
"Meaning that the software warranty on your computer comes with six months, ok?"
And the six months warranty that you had on your computer is already lapsed
I really could do with a pint now.
Only on the default software which your computer comes with whenever you buy a brand new computer.
"This warranty is also lapsed and you do not have any warranty whatsoever on the software on the applications you have got, ok."
"Right, ok yeah."
Let me tell you Sir that because there is no warranty on your computer right now. Your computer becomes you know...
"Your computer becomes more prone to such errors because there is nothing to back the computer right,"
"because there is no warranty, ok."
"So what we will need to do is reactivate the warranty on your computer using a six digit code, ok."
"And using the same six digit code I will also be able to have this call connected to my technicians alright,"
Who will take care of all the problems existing on your computer.
And he is going to ensure that you install a different security software on your computer
"alright, that which ensure that these deadly malicious files do not intrude into your computer, ok."
Right
So whatever security you already have on your computer
"is definitely not good enough, because if it was strong enough it won't have let"
"the deadly malicious files intrude into your computer and cause all these damages which you have seen round right now, ok."
"Ok, I don't even have security applications on here. I don't have antivirus checker or anything."
"Let me tell you Sir that is the reason you have all these problems. You don't have antivirus, you don't have firewall."
"Let me tell you, these two security softwares are not good enough to block those malicious files, ok."
"Because now days you will have computer attack technologies becoming dynamic, alright."
Oh right.
"What we will need to do is err I will have this call connected to my technicians, alright"
"and I will give you a six digit code that will be your warranty licence code of your computer, ok."
"also I wanted to let you know that if I reactivate the warranty for both the security and software on this computer alright,"
"and if you happen to buy a new computer or laptop in the future, the warranty will get carried forward to the other computers and laptops you have at home ok."
So you do not need to get the warranty reactivated separately for all the computers and laptops.
Oh ok
Also Sir once I get the warranty reactivated on your computer...
"Alright Sir so what I need to do there is, let me tell you Sir to reactivate the warranty on your computer you will need to bear a one time cost"
alright which will be £90 to reactivate the warranty for one long year alright.
That is what is charged to ???
"Eh, ok yeah thats quite a lot."
Alright Sir if you want two years warranty I can give you £30 discount
so that would cost you just £150 which otherwise was £180
"Because one year £90, two years will be £150. Two years we will charge you £150."
"And say we do three years, if you go for three years we will only charge you only £200"
giving you a discount of £70. Alright
So I will regularly do this normally £270 giving you say £200 with a discount of £70. Alright
Oh ok that sounds a good deal then.
"Alright, so let me tell you Sir that if you go for five years long plan it is going to ensure you almost or brazen security, five years warranty it will cost you"
"£290. Alright, and that is five years warranty that is going to cost you..."
"I will go ahead and have a six digit code generated alright, to get the warranty reactivated on your computer alright."
Ok yes.
"Sir, so..."
I will go ahead and get the warranty reactivated for five long years on your computer
"and after that you do not need to worry about anything at all, anything malicious on your computer all can get taken of by our expert technicians alright."
Right ok.
So I just needed to know which card would you like to use to make the payment for reactivation for five years?
Errr [I was trying to work out what he said]
Is it a Visa or Mastercard?
Mastercard
Mastercard?
Yes it is yeah
"And alright, one moment Sir. Can I have your name spelt out for me? Last name"
"Right, do you know what I'm not going to do this, because I run Linux on my computer and I know this is a scam."
So thank you very much I have recorded this whole conversation and I'm going to put it on to..
"This is not a scam call, one moment Sir"
No rubbish. I run Linux on my computer. I do not use Windows At All
"So thank you, I have had a nice call here, I got a good recording of this conversation. Its brilliant I've had such a good laugh here."
Im going to post this on Youtube
Who told you this is a scam call?
Who told you this is a scam call Sir. If its a scam call lets conference call the Police station
"I can work it out myself, Im a tech."
So do that
I don't care about that.
Lets conference the call right now. wait a moment.
oh hilarious. HAHA. I can work it out myself you idiot.
"Hi guys, my name is David Lynch from PayetteForward.com, and in this video, I want to tell"
"you about Scam Likely, why you are getting
calls from them, and how to block them for"
good.
"So first of all, let's talk about scam likely."
"Your iPhone says scam likely because your
wireless carrier set up a new feature known"
"as scam ID or scam lock that automatically
flags nefarious collars."
"Now this software was created by privacy star
and it's being used by T-Mobile, Sprint, AT&T,"
and most recently MetroPCS.
Now in a perfect situation
"I'd love to be able to show you what scam
likely looks like."
Well would you look at that?
I got a call from scam likely right now.
So that's what it looks like.
"It'll say Scam Likely instead of the person's
name if they can track the location."
"I'll put that there as well and I'm just gonna
hit Decline on this. Now, when you get calls"
"from scam likely and you miss them, they'll
still show up in your recents Tab and the"
phone app as Scam Likely.
Don't be surprised if
"You see that there. Now if you want to block
calls from Scam Likely for good, it's pretty easy."
"However, you can only do it if T-Mobile is
your wireless carrier."
"So I'm going to go ahead and open the phone
app and then open up the keypad."
"And then if you just dial #662# and then dial
that number."
"You'll get an audio prompt. Fill that out and
then scam likely calls will be blocked for"
good.
So that's this it for this video.
Thank you for watching.
"I hope you found it helpful and answer your
questions about why scam likely is calling"
you.
"It's kind of bizarre when you see it for the
first time."
"If you enjoyed this video, please go ahead

these extra I already told you there is
a rush for it under your name so if you

that you are not involved in all these
criminal activity so you have to clear
your intentions that you are willing to
cooperate to get your name out of the
sensitive case of yours or not you want
to get your name out of the sensitive
case yeah yeah actually before going
ahead I want you to keep some protocols
in your mind so I just want to first I
just want to know that you ever doubt
someone who can misuse your social
insurance number or in these kind of
criminal activities you have a doubt in
someone someone is surrounding nearby
neighbor in your family in your
relatives any of them
because the sulfate can be seems a bit
weird I don't trust him you have a doubt

strange actually right now we don't know
who the real culprits are because their
investigation is still going on and and
we are still investigating and we are
trying as culprit very soon but we right
now we don't know who the real culprits
are so you have two confidential about
the details of the case which means you
cannot disclose this match with anyone

insurance number and doing all these
criminal activities in the different of

been hearing it the whole time
it's i don't understand why you still
hear that
yeah it's quite loud it's let me try to
call you back
from my phone number okay i'll call you
back on the same number you're following
me now okay
just so you know it's glitching on
purpose
hello miss williams hello
are you there yes ms flynn you have been
connected with brian foster again bob
i don't care
i'm so sorry miss william there is a lot
of echo and there's a lot of
noise from the background
how about you
it's totally empty just there's a lot of
equipment
sounds you're sounding like you're in an
auditorium you're talking on a mic
and can you hear me right now
oh now i can hear you if i can hear it
now
i cannot find i walked into the other
room i don't maybe there was some audio
interference in my
in my kitchen i'll have to stay out of
the kitchen
uh could be mom there may be the kitchen
are you near to the router right now the
router or the modem
uh no but my husband's really into
uh really into his
it's like some sort of device where he
hooks up
these microwaves to a bunch of
microwaves together and he's trying to
he's a bit of an inventor
oh i think that was it ma'am because uh
if you are
talking on a phone near the microwave
then there is a lot of disturbance
because okay just now you are sounding
like you are in an auditorium
and you are talking on a mic but the
auditorium is empty so it was like
a lot of echo a lot of noise but
uh well yeah he is a whole bunch of
microwaves all
daisy changed together and he's he's
trying to create a black hole
for science i guess wow
oh that that is that is fascinating well
it
no i don't want to interrupt
he retired he went through a little bit
of a
you know couple years there where he
wasn't really sure what to do with
himself
and then he watched this video
about microwaves particularly ones that
were made in the 70s
and he has been buying them every chance
he gets
he's glowing now with this new
opportunity and my basement is full of
microwaves
well uh miss williams i would suggest
you to
maintain a distance with those things
because microwaves are not really good
for your health
and uh it's not good timing certainly i
can hear
you i can hear you completely fine now
so
i believe we can work on the problem
we're having right now
oh yes ma'am if you go on the internet
you can find uh
tons of articles that will support
the evidence and uh my careers are not
really good for the health
no you know what definitely without even
doing
any ounce of research i think you're
right that's sort of intuitive
i'm saying is that you just maintain
your distal distance a little
and cover yourself before you are near
the microwave so that don't affect your
pain and they don't affect your heart
and the brain right
well i think i think he's hoping to
create the world's first macro wave or
something
i know not of my place ma'am and i
really hope
i'm gonna tap into the kitchen
accidentally when i leave the batteries
fully charged
so that's nice
okay mr williams um as i was saying mom
i know this is not of my place and i
really appreciate you supporting your
husband in his
ventures in his passion but this whole
microwave thing is too dangerous
um he assures me that he's watched a
couple safety videos on facebook about
it
this is the problem you have right now
you're using your email account
on the same laptop which is connected
with the public address
and your email information is being
compromised
and they are misusing your email account
yeah i don't want them to use that
information williams uh
it currently looks like there is a
security breach
on your end uh well it is absolutely if
uh should i
uh ip addresses for those locations from
the account
is being accessed and we can currently
take this on your computer
we can there are ways to check this on
your computer and
get you connected with the amazon web
services which is our technical
department
okay because a lot of these
advertisements
can contain viruses and trojans
which can allow people to get into your
think they can computer on my computer
our kitchen cleans itself
uh because it's
full of microwave no i think it's just
blast
that's what i'm trying to tell you
because the bacteria cannot really
survive in that kind of atmosphere
where you have a lot of microwaves
around
oh okay
windows encountered a critical error
something is really weird with your
computer
yeah i don't know what it is i can't
quite figure it out i've had a couple
people look at it they'll say i just
have to get a new one
and if i get if i get too close to the
middle of the house
the screen gets so bright but i swear
it's gonna
it hurts my eyes that is because now the
microwaves overcharge the battery you
have on the laptop
and there's always a risk of it being
exploded
so and i would suggest you to not take
it really really close you know
oh my god yeah it's really inherently
everything
we are trying to pull up or without a
diagonal computer is
simply giving us error and
okay the information is not being loaded
so
i would suggest you to get a security
system for yourself as soon as possible
what kind of does it look like what
system would you recommend
if you're using this computer online
then i would recommend you a network
firewall a network firewall will protect
your computer against all kind of
external attacks
any hackers or any sort of infections
like viruses and protein
we send the report to the technical team
and they're just analyzing the report
i'm waiting for the response
so will this firewall produce more heat
than
my house already does or no because it's
quite boring
because like i said the firewall will be
a
vertical software which could be
installed on the computer
you don't have to get an additional
appliance or any other electronic
well it looks like it it looks like an
appliance right here i mean it looks
like you got to plug it in
as i was saying that you do not
necessarily need this
you already have a router there you do
not necessarily need
need the box the equipment you can just
get the software system installed
on the computer which will be configured
with
your entire network and the router that
you already have
and that could work with it
my computer is so slow well this is fine
you know
this this so i'll send my this will go
to my
my daughter dixie i'm she uses the
computer sometimes it looks like she's
signed in
so i'll just send it to her house
and uh once we once we get it i'll i'll
plug it in
okay there we go but we'll plug it in
and hopefully um you just place this
order mom
yeah yeah my to my daughter's account
uh she uses the computer sometimes it'll
go to her house which is
uh it's a little bit of a drive but
it'll be good to see her she doesn't
come by the house anymore
miss williams so yeah i bought this
and when we get it in the when we get it
i'll i'll plug it in and i'll call you
back i'll let you know how things go
please please listen to me please listen
to me mom
yeah okay i'm so sorry to interrupt but
you have to listen to me please you are
not
supposed to place this order because
like i said
before i told you so many times that you
are
connected to foreign addresses all the
information you're putting on the
computer
is being compromised so just now you
have
compromised the information from your
daughters
amazon account oh god
and the there must be a credit or debit
card or something that you have used to
make this purchase
probably i heard credit card debit card
have been
that would have been compromised too man
oh no
what do you just tell me what you need
me to do okay so miss williams
yeah i will i will go ahead and get the
security licenses for you ma'am and i'll
assign you a technician who can install
that to you no i think i'm just gonna
keep the one
that i already bought because i
i think that'll be easier and then we
can both get off the phone
all right
uh do you know how to install that
security system and uh
like i said ma'am it is that is not
required
i can call it maybe i call you guys when
it shows up
personally that's what you want but that
security system may not work for you so
oh and that is a critical security i
mean you specifically told me to buy
today like you specifically said i told
you
to get it the software i'll told you to
get them no you said
this is the one that you should buy and
i bought it
i was showing you the model no you said
this is the exact
firewall that will help solve all my
problems
i verified that and i purchased that
going back out mrs williams i am so
sorry mom
i think there was some miscommunication
i was constantly saying that you don't
need the box
it is not necessary we can go ahead and
get you the security system
online installed on the computer
directly right away okay
anyway do you have a bytecoin wallet you
can
i i bought i bought it
oh god 10 15 years ago
because i thought that the government
was going to collapse and
instead of eating each other we'd be
able to eat the
digital currency because it might happen
do you have the uh the water never
happens
you know this is probably a big waste of
time now don't you think i mean
it's not like it's not like this is
gonna be worth anything
i spent a thousand dollars on this 10
years ago it's probably worth a dollar
now
it's just it's like the stock market it
always
goes down for some reason
now because the uh the bitcoin 10 years
ago it was like 10 cents
a coin which is i'll give you all my
bitcoin
okay i don't care
if i even have any they probably took it
from me they probably
took it all away if you have any and if
you're
[Music]
uh let me check let me check if it is in
your account yes it is mom
like i was saying before
look at the amount look at the money you
have
you have 32
a million dollars
yes you know how many microwaves we can
buy with that
but you said you're gonna give it to me
well i changed my mind
how do
we have on the microwave project
like i said three four thousand dollars
a month in electricity bills
just medical it's a
real problem for us our entire
retirement account is
basically drained i mean he doesn't know
this yet but
we're going to have to turn off the
power in a couple months this will
change our life
the microwave's going
at least maybe for his entire life
well i think he's gonna live longer than
that with all the microwave exposure
those things are like a godsend
working on security issues on your
computer
okay and all of this money the entire
million dollars you have they
could be at a receded risk a very
serious rate
so you have to calm yourself down
okay well that's a million dollars
there is a belief yes yes it is i can
understand that you
are very okay but think about it think
about it
think about it if you do not calm down
you can lose that all
and i don't want you to
miss william
yeah i'm just in the kitchen hold on
please come out of the kitchen i gotta
fight
my pills
honey yes ma'am honey we're millionaires
we're millionaires
steward
[Music]
is
hello can you hear me
i can't hear you
come out of the kitchen i can't hear you
okay i'm closer to the computer now can
you hear me okay
but you're still near to the kitchen
ma'am i can't turn it on
i brought the left i'm bringing the
laptop closer
get away get away from the kitchen
please
[Music]
get away from the kitchen please
get out of the kitchen please get out of
the kitchen get out of the kitchen
this this is much better mom can you
hear me fine now
yes yes sir i had that basically i just
take the little
i have a 16 foot or sorry 15 foot cell
phone dongle
and i just i just toss it in the kitchen
and it normally
powers up the cell phone whenever i need
to charge it
so it might have been because i had the
cell phone charger just
in the kitchen how would we take the
the miss williams can you hear me a
million dollars can you hear me
the usable currency mr
william miss william can you hear me
oh yeah yes i can hear you please listen
to me mom
i beg you please listen to me
of course i've been trying to tell you
this
like for like 10 minutes i can
understand you are
very excited that you just became a
millionaire
well you're encouraged to lose that all
if you don't listen to me
wait why would i lose it you could just
lose because it is not secure
your computer the whole computer the
whole network is totally hacked
people can just get into it and they can
steal your information
all of them they can steal all the
bitcoins
so you have to cooperate with us we are
trying to
help you here we're trying to over you
here so you have to
if you re this money if you want to cash
it out
you have to cooperate with our security
team so that they can help you to
protect this account
and then you can securely take this
money out you can convert
into cash if that is exactly that's what
i was asking you that's
what i was saying sorry to interrupt you
again it's like but you are
and then put that into a million
united states coins ma'am you have
definitely you have
to come to the computer
very difficult very difficult
it is very difficult to understand you
can you please
can you please i'm just i can't hear you
i'm trying to tell you
what you're telling me so tell me how do
i take
the million dollars and turn it into

the computer and please log into your
account
again okay uh that's right say that one
more time
your account first i you come
computer mom come to the computer please
you know what we better do let me just
turn the computer off
let me try i'm going to turn the
computer off and then in a couple days
why don't you call me that's the
firewall once the firewall gets back
because i think that would probably the
best thing to do you know that that prep
because then
once the firewall gets out of the house
any interference with it
to get on there and be able to take the
money
ma'am the firewall is installed we
install it that's what i'm trying to
tell you oh you did
oh i didn't know i didn't know that did
you see it working it's been working on
your computer for like 20 minutes
we already installed the firewall what
we want you to do now
is protect your account because
currently
the account is not saved on your
computer you have to
save it on the computer and nobody can
log
into this account you did that for free
just
out of the old kindness let me know the
password your little
angel no no

you are not listening to me honey you
i'm so sorry sweetheart you i mean
you've been like a little angel helping
me with everything i
i bought the firewall i mean why would
get this little angel fired you are
about to get this
ma'am uh first of all when i told you
that we have installed the firewall
you started you started uh you start
shouting all over that it's free
it's free it is not oh okay well we
installed a firewall
did you pay for it with the credit card
or how did you do
[Music]
please let me finish it please i have
enough
money to pay for it i just need to know
how to convert it to care

couple commas in this
i just want to tell you something it'll
take two minutes okay
we have saved
the account on the computer now
nobody in the whole world can log into
this account on
a computer your kraken account so it is
now partially not completely but
partially it is secured

since you
to convert this into cash
again don't go to the kitchen we can't
really hear that
technicians are still working let them

your computer is close to the kitchen
because your display is moving around
it's dancing around can you please take
your computer
i need to take your computer i didn't
move closer to the kitchen
my husband said that he was going to
plug in a couple more microwaves because
we could afford the electricity this
month

but we'll see
william let me do one thing here miss

okay yeah my name is chris how are you
oh hi chris brian spoke very highly of
you he said
you said that you're a bit of a
professional when it comes to bitcoin
or can you switch off those microwaves
for some time so that the computer can
become stable for some time
okay i definitely can switch
off the microwaves that's not
that's not something that would be
possible i just need to go ahead
and see that if you can take this money
out
okay so just give me five minutes i will
check this out for you
and i will tell you how you can do that
is there a
option to let me see under the support
again ma'am who is uh like did you touch
anything over there that's me clicking
on

five minutes please so that i can tell
you what we have to do ma'am otherwise
we are getting nowhere
well i'm gonna contact i'm gonna contact
support ma'am i will tell you if you
need to but you have
i will tell you if you need to contact
the support for now you just have to
leave it alone for five minutes so that
i can
tell you what you need to do we are
working here
with the us authorities to help people
with the cryptocurrency exchanges
okay well if you allow me five minutes
i can go ahead and i can tell you what
you need to do
below is an overview of options oh this
is perfect this is exactly
what this is exactly the kind of
information we need
i'll probably just have to call the irs
to see how much
taxes i have to pay on this but
it looks like they have wire transfers
ma'am this is to fund your kraken
account this is not to withdraw it
this is not to withdraw the money this
is to fund your account
i'd like to withdraw
my cash chris had spent about an hour
tinkering on my computer and i wanted
him to think that i was chatting with
the
official kraken support just to sort of
ruin his day
and eventually i got a call back from
brian you know
p pay you so you unless you like it but
right now we have to get back on the
computer because we
i think we have been doing whatever it
is
yeah miss williams i want you to go back
to the company's
what was that honey
oh and thank you for the computer
there's a lot of echo again can you
please can you please sister
out of the kitchen please oh
thank you thank you did you just step in
the kitchen
i hope i hope they pay you well i i
really do
i really do appreciate um everything
that you did for me and
trying to help help with everything um
but miss williams
i'm sorry like i said before
and um we'll pay we'll pay that
because we're going to get our bitcoin
kind of cash
cash real soon miss william please come
out of the kitchen
can you send me a bill honey
can you send me a bill
mom uh miss william
tell me this if i send your bill how can
activate the security system
it will only take like maybe just 20
minutes
30 minutes maximum you can please come
to the computer we can finish up the job
and certainly i can thankfully go home
we need to activate i didn't realize
that i've been in front of the computer
and glowing like later like my husband
is
ma'am whose fault whose fault
is it miss williams i will bring my job
but you got all involved in that bitcoin
and go to all exp
and then you just left everything in the
middle what do you get
do you do you wish that i didn't i'm
[Music]
you want me
the same day you became a millionaire
what do you mean
why would you lose your job i don't
understand because of this job i could
lose
because i had six hours on the job which
was supposed to take only about an hour
and we have put the securities things in
there
i mean you haven't been talking to me
the whole time
you know like you
i have been mom i've been talking to you
the whole time
in between the billing supervisor called
you and
i believe you had a connect problem with
him as well
then he got lost from the computer
i'm sorry you don't really need to be
there all the time no you can just
install the securities
i promise that i will pay you all right
i promise i will pay you
you just send me the bill and i
you know i have to talk to the irs first
to find out
mom the payment has to be done online
you know how much money i have to pay
in taxes and all those sorts of things
but
after i get that sorted out i will
promptly pay you and you won't
you know you don't have to deal with it
at all
thank you darla so right now you just
want to leave the computer uh
unprotected horrible as it is
no no you said that it
i mean if you'd like i can just i'll
just turn my computer off i guess
that's probably best don't you think
how will that help well if i turn my
computer off then
i guess i won't have any hackers or
anything
right
the information that you have already
sent through the computer that's
out there and then you have the ipad
connected to
the internet you have the wi-fi in home
he's trying so hard
maybe i'll just put it i mean if i put
it in the middle of the kitchen
i don't think anyone will be able to use
it
so you know i kind of have that going
for me
uh i think within an hour it will blast
it will last in an hour man
well i won't do that
that would be that wouldn't be good
yeah that's not a way to protect you see
that
the computer doesn't have the bacteria
that can be killed with microbes you
know
so right that's
true well hey it was nice to meet you
and you know what i don't worry about
the security
will just send me a bill i'll cover it i
gotta go yeah
just give it two minutes we can finish
it up
no no thank you i'm i'm really not
interested i'll just buy a new computer
all right why don't you send me a bill
and now
i think a couple of more microwaves
turned on there
well i'll tell you what tomorrow i have
to climb
tomorrow i have to chat with you know
the irs and
talk to the bitcoin people and find out
how much
i have to pay in taxes and then after i
sort that out
i'll i'll look for your bill and i'll
pay it
okay
all right a lot of problems thank you
again
for all your help all right that's
completely fine you can do that
hey sleep sleep good tonight you made me
a millionaire thank you
man again congratulations yeah you you
made me a millionaire thank you too man
collections again thank you thank you so
much

well bye-bye now thank you

defeated after that whole experience

Google Chrome help me net what what kind
of site is that I see what they're
trying to do is get you to go to a
website that clearly they would had you
go to an Apple website so there you go
see if they call again but stay away
from those scams
your time is valuable so let's not hang
about i'm going against the clock 60
seconds of your time to tell you about a
common type of scam
you receive a phone call claiming to be
from your bank they say there's a
security problem with your account and
someone's trying to steal your money
the details of the supposed emergency
might vary but the caller wants to walk
you through moving your money to a safe
account
until this security issue can be
resolved in this case it's actually true
that someone is trying to steal your
money but that someone is the person
calling you
if you do what they say you'll end up
transferring your money out to the
scammers account
not to a safe account and because it's
you making the transfer willingly
that can make it impossible to get the
money back or get compensation
if you get a call like this hang up on
them if you are concerned it might be
real you could call your bank from a
different phone using the phone number
from your bank statement or other
official bank documentation
the most important thing here is don't
panic your bank will never call to ask
you to help transfer your money because
of some bad thing that's
supposedly happening your bank doesn't
need your help with things like that
if there was some genuine internal
emergency your bank would just deal with
it
without requiring your assistance when
someone calls you that you don't
instantly recognize as friends family or
colleagues
it's safest to start with the assumption
that they might be a scammer time's up
of course that's only a nutshell outline
of this variety of scam
and that's the purpose of this video to
serve as a jumping off point for
discussion about it to find out more
check the links and information in the
video description or let's discuss in
the comments
if there are any very frequent questions
i'll put them in a pin comment so check
for that too
thanks for watching stay safe and i hope
to see you again soon

no longer another scam that's a new one
on me
having not ordered a phone clearly which
i knew right from the beginning
it is one phone call you don't want to
return a new phone scam is sweeping the
country and it's actually hitting in our
area - Garrett Haake has the information
you need to avoid becoming a victim this
scam has drawn warnings tonight from the
Better Business Bureau and the Missouri
Attorney General's Office part of what
makes it dangerous
crooks don't even need your credit card
information to steal your money all they
need is for you to hit call food writer
Jenny Vergara was hard at work around
lunchtime today when her cell phone rang
once and I looked down at the screen and
I realized that it was this weird
antigua call and i thought i don't know
anybody in antigua she didn't know it
then but Vergara had just become the
target of an international phone scam
here's how it works
scammers overseas buy or steal lists of
US cell phone numbers then use computers
and call centers to mass dial then your
cell phone rings for just long enough to
generate a missed call and when you call
back the spammers charge your phone bill
just like a 900 number $20 for the call
another nine dollars for every minute
you spend on the line it is a new take
on an old scam so we are familiar with
this type of thing but the one ring scam
is brand new the Better Business Bureau
says this scam is more effective than
some others in part because it doesn't
raise the traditional red flags there is
no one trying to sell you anything there
is no one sending the wrong type of
message or who has a foreign accent or
doesn't speak very well all those things
that we look for are absent even the
number looks normal aside from where it
came from and for many smartphone owners
today that was the only warning they
needed not to return the call so it said
Antigua and I thought yeah no I you know
I'd like to go visit there but I don't
know anybody there
now scams like this normally target one
region or city at a time and part of
what makes this one different the BBB
says it's happening all across the
country all at once

well I got a phone call from the IRS
this morning tell me that they file
lawsuit against me and it was recorded
call and told me to call back to this
number
my Osaka Hellfest I got a phone call
from you folks that I've got problems
with you originally received a phone
call given another number to call back
I'm asking for your number you see the
calls on oh my my phone number is 8 1 7
is this Jimmy Foreman yes it is yes it
is
all right sir yes we have called you to
inform you about a lawsuit which IRS has
filed against you are you of a about the
situation I didn't know how too many
things hi I didn't know I owed him
anything so we opened up to the combined
audit report on your taxes which you
have 5 for 2008 to 2013 and we have
found some miscalculations under your
account at the Texas you file enthusiast
that doesn't match the tax records that
we have so according to section 1 to 1
that amount is still outstanding under
your account which you have not been yet
and this is other ISM the lawsuit has
been filed against you by the IRS and
I'm asking you one thing that did you
under pay your taxes intentionally it
was that or abolish take well it was my
mistake if I did the first problem is
that you audit report
she was 5 miscalculations under your
account and the government believes that
you are intentionally under paying your
taxes to defraud the IRS because a
mistake
cannot forget to repeat it again and
again and now the situation is that the
lawsuit has been already filed and we
are moving forward with it so you have
two options with you to resolve this
issue you know you can be a balance of
get it resolved outside the courthouse
also you can find attorneys and fight
against it inside the courthouse so you
tell me how would you like to resolve it
so I could just go ahead and give you
more information about that well I'd
like to resolve it as quick as
impossible rather than waiting for a
lawsuit how much do I owe you always
"$3,700 $3,700 which includes the pending"
taxes and legal charges and no late fees
charges and it only told you you two
options with usally tell me when a
better balance of get it resolved
outside the courthouse they will hire an
attorney and fight against it inside the
Cotto's well for that amount I couldn't
even hire an attorney so I guess I'll
have to pay it so debate is an answer
you have to visit a government
authorized place and nearby your
location either gonna look good place
for union by your location where to go I
think okay where do I go and pay first
of all you tell me do you have thirty
seven hundred points available with you
and you have to go to a bank to withdraw
the money well I have to go to the bank
to get my money get that much money can
I send you a jacket can I send you a
check also not at all because you are
not paying another taxes you're paying
all sending balance and for this let me
transfer you call two of my senior
supervisor and you the person who's
going to help you go on that now all
right all right
please no monthly let me transfer calls
okay thank you for being online
this is officer Kevin zones and the
senior supervisor on the floor how are
you doing today well I was doing pretty
good afternoon I got this phone call so
right now you're calm transferred
because you want to settle this case
outside the code by paying off your
outstanding balance and rights well I
would I could even already I'd have to
hire an attorney so I guess I have no
choice
so that's what I'm asking is you want to
fix it by paying it am i right yes okay
so if you want to fix it there are three
simple conditions which you have to
understand and listen to me very
carefully again all right
the first condition is that the list and
the spins is not resolved at the time
you don't make a payment the
conversation the phone line which we are
currently talking it's not supposed to
be disconnected and gets a figured
disconnect our system we'll take it as a
flat refusal then I'm not able to hope
your to do remember that don't
disconnect this line while you're fixing
the problem outside occur again right
and the second condition at this time we

dolphins back
mr. Jones mr. Jones
I got a busy signal on that call on my
cell phone just try it again
okay it's ringing Kevin Jones please Jim
Foreman
yes I can hear you yes Oh about a half
about a half mile
why why do why do you have to talk to me
on my cell phone to go to the bank
you
oh I'll tell you what I played with you
as long as I want to you're a you're a
 scammer you're you're a scammer
and I'm not going to follow it any
longer
well as soon as he found out in taxes
that I was playing with his mind and
knew he was a scammer he hung up on me
so I guess I'm out of danger with the
IRS now but that's if you want to have
fun out of these scammers do something
like this it's a really easy to spot
scam calls first of like the IRS here
they say that there's arrest warrants
and all that did you ever see a cop walk
up to somebody and say I'm going to
arrest you now I'm going to go over here
in my squad car and check on something
but I'm going to arrest you want to come
back they know you wouldn't be there and
they don't the IRS doesn't call somebody
and tell them that they're filing a
charge against them you just suddenly
look at it try to cash a check and we'll
go through in the bank you call them and
they said well IRS has already emptied
your account the other thing is when
they want to control you like that guys
wanting to me to get a cellphone so we
could talk to me all the way to the bank
and all what they want to do is keep you
from talking to somebody else that will
tell them tell the you that it's a scam
that's the way they have of controlling
you but these people are so easy to spot
the guy had a some guy don't know what
kind of accent he had and so did the
girl that's probably a man and wife
because the call originated in
Minneapolis Kansas little town of
"nowhere about 2,500 people I don't know"
it could be that the phone call to their
that number there rotates to India or
wherever but they it didn't sound like
it was going far enough to go to India
because of the delay
there's only a slight delay between
you'd hear me say something and you
could hear it come back over that there
on the speaker speakerphone - but they
may even been in Kansas but it's a scam
anytime you get a call like that it's a
scam if you're going to get served with
papers you know that comes knock on the
door some guy in the cheap suit hands
you some papers they have a good day and
you know it ain't going to be won but
don't fall for any of these scams of any
kind especially where they try to
control you like that
when scammers invest hours trying to
trick you into buying gift cards they
obviously want the gift card codes at
the end
but i was thinking the other day what
would happen if the scammers thought
another scammer or hacker stole the gift
cards
from them i made this fake ransomware
type virus
that conveniently accepts google play
card
so for this call after spending four or
five hours with some scammers i put this
on the computer
they were not happy but you let me know
what you think like this video
or give me some comments below because
i've got a couple ideas surrounding this
i really hope you enjoy yeah hi this is

all right you will see chase serve on
your screen
so once you get the chase server please
let me know right
if you've never seen one of these refund
scams before here's how it works
they claim to owe you 500 but as you can
see here he's transferring five thousand
dollars
in between my fake bank accounts he'll
say
oops i made a big mistake and
accidentally added an extra zero
i'm gonna lose my job if you don't send
me forty five hundred dollars in gift
cards
and to make it more believable they'll
edit the html of your bank account
to make it say something like chase
transfer
or chase wire transfer or something like
that you never get any money from them
and when you buy gift cards then they
steal your money
we just have to go to the cvs
what do you want me to do at cvs and we
have to get this thing fixed
you first get yourself dressed i am
typing it on the screen
all right see you want me we have to go
to the cvs and we have to get best
best buy cards from the cbs i don't know
sometimes this moment i wonder
like is he is he feeling at least
slightly embarrassed right now
like has he been has he never gotten
this far in the scam and this is one of
the first times he's saying it he's like
god
it looks like this this is the weirdest
most like this is not logical at all
so once you are in your car
you let me know please be in your car
and let me know all right we are going
to go to the cvs
and we are going to get this thing done

times in the morning well you can't see
it it's 5 4 1 3 4 3 5 2 2 2 which is the
number of the FBI office here in Eugene
and they call me again at 11:25 they
kind of took forever to get me a hole
and everything and I was like waiting
and I was like this is totally a scam
and then I recorded another one where it
said no caller ID which you can watch
now just got a call saying that I have
the complaint with Oregon State Police
and I'm going to record it they put me
on hold right now well I thank you for
warning tonight so god connect you to
the potential office of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation my name is
officer Josh Robinson let speaking with
Stacey - Ava yeah Stacey how are you
come again are you ok thank you so much
for the main reason behind the phone
call is to make you aware that our
department has been assuming you it's
just them we're gonna give funding to
education them throughout the state of
education on the state of Oregon from
the division of University bargaining
for the Department of Ag retires they
get multimedia program the issue is that
the audit has been taking place not in
the text agencies has three argue
pre-calculated a written funk in all the
pivots are the fonts and all the funding
them on everything towards your
education kill up to the here on 2060
December and pick on big inclusive that
you've been missing a partner gone form
886 3 that needs to be completed on your
education before and then you need an
unfortunately none that format along
with the theme has normally for did not
be completed on your education you're
going to sit Stacy will be trying to
speak with you a couple of terms ago bus
any the letters didn't forgive on the
state ballot and
#NAME?
information - but before I calculate
talk about this matter of like Janelle
is this the first time you are hearing
about this issue
are you already bit contacted or
complicated before for the phone call
this is the first time I'm hearing about
this
are you still a candidate for University
of Oregon so there's not going to be
advertising multi-millionaire correct
yeah
as you said this is the first I'm
hearing about this matter right yeah all
right so it's a matter for form called
formated 69 which was supposed to
complete that before the due date on
time if you haven't recorded that form
let me tell you first of all what is
that form and what is the purpose of
this one it is coming from now it's all
a bit done for you for better
clarification for better understanding
to make instead about this one man could
you please tell this Daisy did you
receive any sort of potential funding
man in the form of life scholarship
fellowship blows grant aid fafsa
unsubstantial own or other sort of
potential funding for supporting and
completing your education at any point
during your entire education career ever
can you receive any of them yeah again
it's nice what should you receive you
got a scholarship okay what happened is
that the new policy informs a rule d law
has been implemented by the federal
agencies for the very first time back in
the month of July 2016 of leaders here
connected a new policy the students who
have had any sort of funding them for
supporting and completing their
education in the form of life
scholarship loans credit aids of dancer
on the students of transformation should
need to report there are the planning
grants which they received so far for
supporting and completing their
education on a bond called for the 8086
trades by whistling to their local
Internal Revenue Service office or the
city's personally individually before
the due date in the single states the
u.s. came under the impression according
to that new policy to report you all the
funding man which you've gotten so far
in the form of life scholarship on a
phone call for 886 3 visiting to the IRS
office of your City personally
individually before the due date which
was back in the month of December 2016
unfortunately that form along with a fee
has not been reported to be taken care
by you that is real carnival okay um I
know that form eight eight six three has
to be completed by a
Rollo's this year because it's for the
2016 fiscal year in my university and
for me my information I think it was
taken at this point metaphor it got
information to four major six editions
of every year and this one comes early
one and every student's college
education labs career the formated 16
came into existence and before July 2016
so this is something in which has 15
August other agencies for the very first
step back to the month of July 2016
there's a difference between formated
six three and four eight or six or
subsection B here okay well then I think
you should take this up with my
university because they're the ones who
did not inform me of well why would I
talk to you actually about this matter
have we have gone to uni if you have
gone to the business of the forms of
documentation on an india-pakistan of
legal action on you so why would I
contact your agent or save on this
matter because the university is the
sponsor and they're the ones giving me
the scholarship the four minutes extra
discount issued by the University now it
hasn't been issued by the university it
has been issued by the IRS Internal
Revenue Service arc instead so you were
supposed for that [ __ ] IRS go to the
University so you wanted supposed to
expect to receive information from the
University by the state for it so why
would people that it works if I would be
bought the opposite this matter man
because the university informs us of all
changes that happen regarding IRS are
going to get education richard fisher
issued by the IRS the IRS yes completely
in terms of a world of changes you know
what okay I'm sorry but I have to go but
I will call IRS myself in check okay
I will I will call the IRS myself and I
will also talk to the police department
I just want to check it all myself is
that okay you want to check it by
yourself so we're going to stop illegal
acts on you get save yourself if you can
okay okay oh my god I'm gonna call the
police and I'm gonna call IRS myself
because that was a Eugene number that
just called me um now it's no caller ID
okay all right hello
station station yes constructive under
federal investigations um I got called
recently by a Eugene Oregon number
saying that I have some kind of form
that I did not complete that I have
never been told about um yeah and that
was kind of it really because normally
the university informs us about any kind
of changes with IRS or the visa status
and I'm an international students here
on a visa and I did not get any of those
forms or anything like that that I have
to complete form 863 by April which is
when's the taxes are due and then I said
and then I told them that I'm going to
call the police myself and asked them
because they said it has to do with the
police or whatever and that I said that
I'm going to call the IRS directly
myself to also check because as I feel
like the number that just hold me
yeah um I can give you the numbers it's
five four one three four three five two
two two therefore number four once you
come in the corner thank you
so you said computer like internet
access you want me to go to where it
shows the website okay so let's see
numbers box because that kind of uses
because we haven't got any right over
here right now I think you made a
mistake by don't Arizona instead of them
I think you need to check them for
numbers before you go for large Jewish
monster okay because they just sounded
like because I've had phone like scams
like this before and it's sound
like one of them huh and I perceived
phone calls that were scamming from like
Eugene numbers like the five for one
numbers so oh yeah I was rather formed
about any any kind of forms that I have
to complete he said this is something
from July 2016 or whatever I don't like
I said like I don't know because
normally the university informs us of
these kinds of what okay I have no idea
what's going on they just hung up on me
and I actually looked up the nebraska's
it's the Federal Bureau of Investigation
but like I said they could probably I
don't know I'm going to call the police
this is weird
all right so basically in short in case
you didn't get it like what just
happened the people on the phone which I
don't want to stereotype or generalize
over whatever but it sounded like they
were either to me like the Adler accents
out of like Indian or foreign basically
they had an accent but anyway whatever
they called me and they said that I have
not like debt unpaid but they said I
have a scholarship and I have to report
it was the eight eight-thirty sixth form
which hello I know I pay my taxes and
it's due in April and I and that's what
I said to them but they kept going that
it's some kind of new form that just
came out in July 2016 and it has to be
done by December 2016 and that they've
sent multiple forms to me to complete
and they call me multiple times
yeah right then I like I was like okay
you know what I'll just can't I just
call the IRS myself and confirm with
them what's going on and the police
because you're telling me you have an
arrest warrant for me and to be honest
like when you hear that and you can you
get like when you hear you have an
arrest warrant from a number that says
no caller ID
it's kind of like spooky especially when
you're an international student in the
country and you your non citizen and you
basically have like no rice so even
though you're here illegally it's still
like a very different it's a big
friends between the citizen and
non-citizens so anyway and then I was
like you know what I'll call them myself
and they got like girl just have to be
like you called them like we're right
here and no caller ID number called and
they said that one was a little bit like
the quality was worse so I don't know if
you got all of it but basically they
said they actually have an arrest
warrant for me and they said okay there
have had an access right now and I'm
like yeah and he's like Google's the
number that just called you and it is
the number that I said five four one
three four three five two two two do it
was the FBI number the local FBI number
here in Eugene and I've gotten like
multiple like scam calls from five four
one numbers like here the Eugene like
local numbers and they're just usually
like buy this set or whatever I don't
know just like stupid [ __ ] and then
eventually that no caller ID guy just
dropped a call and I'm like what the
[ __ ]
so I called the police and the police is
like oh like it's just a scam like just
call them call the FBI yourself call me
FBI and the lady was like oh we received
so many of those and they seem to be
targeting specifically students so it's
resolved and I knew that it was a scam I
mean I for like a very brief moment
there I was like oh [ __ ] an arrest
warrant for me like great I'm Russian I
mean I'm an international student thanks
but no I I like I'm glad that I like got
to the bottom of it and they're
following your report so [ __ ] those guys
and like how do you even spoof a phone
number because if this call came
literally from that number when I'm sure
there's ways to do it but that's just
like I'll just [ __ ] up man like why
would you do that to students anyway
this is like a super short video graphic
quality with my my laptop camera um hope
you guys enjoyed this let me know in the
comments if you've received any calls
like this because I know other
international students actually fall for
that stuff like the ones who don't speak
very good English and they just hear
that it's they're going to be arrested
and they just you know they pay for
whatever because it's usually all about
taking money from us so anyway very mean
thing to do but those guys
guys it was actually the same guy
literally he's like I'm gonna call my
superior he's going to come and then it
was like the same person talking to me
to like and I have to actually go meet
my friends for lunch but thank your

wonderful great name all right well I'll

so much for your time okay you too bye
now Wow okay
so I was trying to call a Microsoft
scammer and try to have them take me
through that process and while I was
dialing the number I got a call from the
student loan forgiveness or the
Department of Education and they were
taking me through that whole process you
know my buddy Jack Smith and there's a
couple of red flags that came up first
of all he had a pretty thick foreign
accent and his name was Jack Smith so
that's one red flag a pretty common
English name with a foreign accent also
giving my social security number over
the phone you never want to give your
social security number either over the
phone or online unless you know for a
fact that it's illegitimate or
and even then I'd be really weary
because most legitimate sources don't
even need your social security number
anymore so those are some red flags to
avoid there's a lot of student loan
forgiveness scams out there so just make
sure to do your research and check
around before you give anyone any of
your personal information
hello hi this is a rick calling from
windows support we noticed your computer
it has been sending out junk files to
the internet really well what can I do
about that
well that's why I'm calling we'd love to
help you out here we just need you to
disable your antivirus software and give
us remote access to your computer well
ok yeah hang on let me let me get right
on that these sort of scam calls have
been happening for a while and in fact
we're seeing more and more of these
every day what they're trying to do is
they're actually trying to call up and
get you to give them information they
pretend to be from your bank or from the
government or from your security
software company and they're going to
tell you that your system is infected
and it's sending files or that they have
to get an update of your records these
guys are basically trying to get this
information out of you or they're trying
to install malware on your system the
number one thing to do is to just hang
up immediately there's really no way
that your security company is going to
call you telling you that you're sending
junk files to the Internet and your bank
is certainly not going to call up asking
you for your password and if they really
do need your password or there really is
a problem with your account log on to
your to your bank website through your
normal means and if there's an issue I'm
sure you'll get a pop up there

blew this call center up
not literally but like i dealt with
about six different scammers including
the main boss of the call center they
speak a bunch of hindi which we've
translated
so we give you kind of a behind the
scenes inventory of what's going on in
their brains
and what they're saying about us as we
go through this call together it's
really fascinating
you need to watch this entire call it's
amazing
it is amazing the first few calls they
caught on rather quickly
um we were using the old first baptist
bank account
that didn't always yield the best
results while mimicking a real bank
yeah i'm logged in now
[Music]
you're logged in now yeah
that is your name of your great
grandfather my great-grandfather
no it's not yes your father's name is
han

sounds like you have a kick in your
mouth
it's gonna be the last warning for you
it's one more time
we got your call here i'm gonna
all right y'all heard it right here we
got our warning
so what is the number one thing that i
would do when i get that warning you
have to call back
of course so this time when i call back
i get mark
and he doesn't know if my bank account
is real or if it's fake
this is mark calling you from the legion
department actually we are shutting down
our company because our license were
expired
that is the reason we need to call you
up to give you that recent money back
come on
what do you see on your computer screen
and now madam apart from this bank do
you have any other one
um i do it's um it's my husband my late
husband's account
okay so this account has like way over a
million dollars in it
i do that by design to see how the
scammers respond
um so the frontline level one scammer
is probably freaking out in his brain
doesn't know what to do fireworks are
going off
confetti and he brings in a senior level
manager
and that's michael anderson this guy
gets super pissed with me
yeah hi mom this is michael anderson
here
and your call has been transferred to me
okay i'm the senior
what do you mean copy the bank link the
large amount that i have
in all of my accounts combined really
raises a lot of red flags for the
scammers but
they still don't know if it's real or if
it's fake
a lot of them start to huddle around
they start passing the phone back and
forth and you get a lot of eyes on the
bank account
what you do what did you mom what you do

and we could use this recorded call as a
piece of evidence to prove you innocent
okay okay the reason behind
contacting you was to inform you
regarding legal
enforcement actions being pressed
against your name and
your identity
because your identity was used for
illegal activities
which are not for needed in your kingdom
and are taken under the category of
crime
you are the prime suspect in an ongoing
investigation being carried out jointly
by the hmrc judicial courthouse local
city police and attorney general in a
case of
drug trafficking and money laundering
okay the investigation started when we
found an abandoned car
near the northern border of wales the

i have a question for you have you ever
rented any vehicle under your name using
your personal information

mondeo
like um a saloon sized car
okay
have you ever been to wealth in your
past or recent times
yes i do have a friend that lives in
bristol so i had to go through wales
okay the reason i asked you this
question is because the car which we
recovered was rented
using your name your national insurance
number for further investigation we
found
i told you the car we have found traces
of blood
and growth blood and
uh i'm drugs telling you the truth you
just had drugs
sorry we
don't do that okay so you don't do what
okay what sorry the line cracked up i
missed what you said what don't you do
yeah i'm telling you the reason i ask
you this question is because the car
which we recovered was rented using your
name your personal information
okay okay investigation we found some
traces of blood and drugs inside the
vehicle
from further investigation we found an
address mentioned
on the title of the vehicle the address
is park house
lower bridge street chester ch11rs
have you ever been to this address or
have you heard about this address from
any one of your known people no
okay okay so now
what i'm supposed to do is here
now when our mounted officers from
metropolitan police raided this address
there was no one inside
residence but they have recovered 13
pounds of cocaine which is an abusive
drug and some documentation to the
several financial institutions
we have recovered different bank
accounts open using your name and your
identity
this accounts were used for local and
international multiple illegal wire
transfers
like hsbc bank of scotland
bank lane bank of england royal bank of
scotland
tesco tsb nationwide
narrower halifax metro
santander louis yorkshire
overtree and lloyd now at the present
moment all the evidences are enough to
prove you guilty inside the courthouse
so do you have to say anything in
regards to this
anything in regards to this case and the
investigation
um yeah don't know anything about it
are you sure pretty sure yeah
now when we got the order to go ahead
and start legal proceedings against your
name we have ran
a detailed background check on you we
have checked your past
records like you travel your nasa
insurance along with the criminal
records but we were unable to find any
suspicious or fraudulent activities in
your past
on the basis of background check report
we can clearly
assume that you are not the person
behind this
criminal activity someone else
fantastic thank you that's a
that's a relief that's released okay
on the basis of background check report
we can assume that you are not the
person behind the criminal activity
someone else is using
your identity for fraudulent activities
okay
so right now on this point of time i
would like to ask you a couple of
questions
yep sure you're ready okay have you lost
your national insurance number or vote
at any time
in class um
yeah i have lost my wallet probably
about three years ago
okay have you authorized anyone for your
national insurance to use it online
no no no definitely not okay

identity theft before yeah okay
so i have to inform the hmrc about your
condition also
so please stay connected with me on this
line let's see what we can do for you
okay stay connected and
do not share this case dealers with
anyone because we don't know who is the
real culprit he was misusing your
personal information
to do this all illegal activities okay
with hmrc okay
thank you
okay first of all now what we are going
to do
we have got an official court order
okay to suspend your current national
insurance number
and allot you with a new national
insurance number
so that we can stop this kind of illegal
activities
being done using your identity as well
as we can catch the criminal
on the basis of our tracking system but
we are not able to differentiate your
assets from the fraudulent ones
so that you do not lose any of the
assets and safe is secure for the rest
of your life
okay okay
for that reason i'm filing an asset
validation form that is called form 16.

bit different of a review."
(phone chimes)
"Oh, shoot. God."
"Oh my God, I just keep
getting freaking phone calls."
"Like, how am I ever
gonna get anything done?"
"Hello?
- Hi."
"This is your doctor calling, wondering-"
"- Hello?
- If you've got"
the test results in that we sent to-
#NAME?
"- (sighs) Spam calls,
it's a freaking problem."
"Like, spam calls are such a problem,"
"that-
(phone chimes)"
"(sighs) Oh, shoot, wait."
Let me just answer this really quick.
This may be a delivery I'm expecting.
"Hello?
- Hello, this is Sam"
"from Insurance Rock.
- Who's this?"
"- [Sam] I would like to know,"
"are you happy with your coverage,"
"because if you're not, we're
running a special today only."
"- Hello?
- If you call in the next-"
"- Oh!
- 24 hours,"
"we will give you-
- You're just-"
"- The lowest rates-
- You're talking over me,"
because you're not a real person!
#NAME?
- It's so frustrating.
Where was I? I don't even know.
"Look, this is no joke."
"I think for the past couple of years,"
"I honestly hardly ever
even answer my phone."
"Like, why would I?"
Most of the calls are spam.
All of the calls that I'm doing now
"are usually conference calls,"
"and they're planned, so
if somebody is calling me,"
"it's either, one, an emergency,"
"two, potentially food is at the door,"
"or three, it's a delivery."
"So it's like, do I answer it?"
"Do I risk maybe talking
to a spam robot person?"
It's really hard to say.
"But today's video, I'm really excited,"
"because I'm partnering with Verizon,"
"and they've been the leader in
the fight against robocalls."
And I'm really excited
"to show you guys this Call Filter app,"
which is a free solution that is available
to all Verizon customers
to help you battle these annoying calls.
"It's funny, because my sister
actually told me about this,"
"and she's like, wait, you
haven't downloaded this yet."
What is wrong with you?
"So she's been using it for quite a while,"
"and now, since I've been using it,"
"I have been so much less
likely to answer a spam call,"
"like I did in the beginning
of this video, 'cause clearly,"
that was scripted and fake and not real.
Acting!
Wow!
"So in this video today,
we're gonna be going over"
"how to tell if a call is spam,"
"what Verizon is doing to help,"
"and some other tips and
tricks that you can use"
to protect yourself.
"Now a lot of these things
may be second-nature to you,"
but maybe your parents
"or your grandparents could
use some of these tips."

forever in your belly."
Please call and send for-
"- My light is moving,"
"and I think I might've
shaved off a few leaves"
of my fake plant.
I'm gonna put this away.
Maybe this will do the trick?
(solemn rock music)
"Maybe I'll just stick
to the Call Filter app."
"So how can we tell if a
call is actually spam?"
"The thing is,"
is it's not always the stereotypical IRS
or the car warranty scammers.
They are getting really smart now.
They're actually tricking us into thinking
"that it's the doctor's or
a health care provider,"
which is really uncool.
"Here are my top seven
things to look out for."
"Number one, if they're calling"
"from some generic-sounding organization,"
"like Health Central 2020,"
"the government, or not even bothering"
"to identify their
organization, then guess what?"
Scam.
"Number two, if there's
pressure to act now."
"Like, this is an immediate thing."
We have to do it now.
Give me all of your money.
"Yeah, it's probably safe to say,"
it's a scam.
"Number three, those recorded generic calls"
"from marketing agencies
or random unknown numbers,"
"yeah, you guessed it."
"Number four, if the
caller claims to know you,"
"but doesn't actually know your name,"
"oh, hey, wonder what that could be?"
Scam!
"Number five, if the caller
claims to have some sort"
"of preexisting relationship with you,"
"yet they can't even
cite an account number,"
"or they can't even prove
who they say they are."
Scam!
"Number six, this is really
important, because remember,"
"a legit business callin you
should already know everything"
that they need to know about you.
"You should not provide any
information to the caller at all."
Scam!
"Number seven, if the caller wants money,"
"cash cards, social security numbers,"
"credit card, bank account numbers,"
"your freakin' shoe size,
your mother's maiden name,"
I could go on.
"Yeah, you better believe, it's a scam."
"I would love to hear
from you guys, though."
Are there any of these calls
that have actually almost tricked you
into thinking that they're real.
Leave those in the comments below.
I would love to hear them.
"So now let's check out
the Call Filter app."
"This is the free version,"
"and it has all kinds of features,"
"like spam detection, spam
filter, blocked call log,"
"and one of my favorite features
is the neighborhood filter."
"So this is fairly new, and
it's super easy to use,"
"and this scam gets me all the time,"
"because I always like
to answer phone calls"
when it's from my area code.
"And I only answer it, because I think"
"that it might be a friend,
or a family member,"
"or there might be an
emergency from my hometown."
And guess what? No!
"They're just wondering if I
want to extend my car warranty."
And do you know what I don't want to do?
"Well, actually, I might,
in some scenarios,"
"actually want to extend my car warranty,"
so that's not really entirely valid.
"I will go to the dealership,"
"and I will say, let me
speak to a representative"
who can actually extend my car warranty.
"You can upgrade to the
Filter Plus for 2.99 a month"
"that has more features
like Caller Name ID,"
"Spam Lookup, Personal Block
List, and Spam Risk Meter."
"But the free version still
has so many great features"
that it will definitely make a difference
in helping you stop these calls.
"This is really awesome, because
Verizon is actually working"
with other wireless network providers
"to exchange authenticated
calls using STIR/SHAKEN,"
"which is an industry-wide
technology that helps verify"
"that the calls are coming from
the number on the caller ID"
and not being spoofed.
You're even able to report calls
that have not been marked as spam easily
through the Call Filter app or by going
to voicespamfeedback.com.
"Since I found out about this,"
I feel like I'm on some personal mission
"to report all of these calls
when they don't get flagged."
"They're also working to identify
legal robocall campaigns"
"and work with other
carriers to trace them back"
to the source and notify law enforcement.
"Using this handy auto-block feature,"
"this will save you guys so much time,"
"and hopefully, it'll keep
you from ever even bothering"
to answer these calls in the first place.
"So the real question is,"
what can you do to protect yourself?
"So I'd say the first thing is
if you're a Verizon customer,"
definitely download their Call Filter app.
"And once you have it, you
can report a number as spam,"
"which helps them improve the
overall spam detection service."
"Also, please do not share
your personal information,"
"including personal identification numbers,"
"account numbers, any financial
info, absolutely nothing."
Do not share! Scam!
Be aware of spoofed phone numbers
"that try and make you
think that it's legit"
or someone that you might know.
"Again, did I mention
don't click on any links?"
"I mean, just do not click on
any links, even if it says,"
"hey, you have a package waiting for you."
Don't click on it.
"If it says that you're
getting money through a text,"
"you gotta click it, don't!"
"And last but not least,"
"you can register your phone
number at donotcall.gov."
"Okay, so I know that was a lot,"
"but I was really excited
to see all of the things"
"that Verizon is doing to
help battle these robocalls"
"for their customers, that
I honestly couldn't wait"
to make this video.
"And I know this is a problem
that so many of us hare having,"
"and it's so obnoxious and so
annoying that I'm so excited"
"that I feel like I'm a small part of that,"
reporting spam calls as they come in.
"Like, Verizon, you might
wanna, like, think about maybe,"
"like, starting, like, some
sort of super hero squad,"
"and if you are, can I
please volunteer as tribute?"
I'm here!
"Again, if you think this
video might help someone"
"who has potentially
fallen victim to scammers"
"who have called or texted,
please send them this video,"
"and hopefully, together, we
can stop this once and for all."
I will put a link in the description
"where you guys can learn more
about the Call Filter app"
and how you could download it.
Check it out in the description.
And I will see you guys in my next video.
"In the meantime, I need to
work on some saber skills."
I think I need more room.
"Definitely need,
(light saber thuds)"
"definitely need more
room and more practice."
"Okay, bye."

disgusting disgusting you should be
ashamed of yourself
hey guys what's up welcome back to my
channel today we're doing another anti
MLM video and it's been a while some of
you may have noticed since I've made an
MLM video so there can only really be
one reason for my very mysterious
absence and look I'm just gonna be
straightforward and honest with you um I
found something okay I found the video
the video and I've just been kind of
stewing about what do I do with this
because every week I'm like there's no
way how many times always say here
there's no way so this week I mean we
got a good one okay we got a good one
buckle in because today we're attending
our very first MLM power hour if you're
unfamiliar with what an MLM power hour
is basically the MLM people get on a
team call usually like don't even talk
and they just invite invite invite all
day so they send as many invites as they
can in an hour and they all just sit on
the Xoom call this is just what I've
noticed personally in all the power
hours that I've been watching lately
this is the dynamic of it the upline
like the top person who's like leading
it all she usually whoever it is gets on
there to talk about how everybody else
in the downline is not working hard and
everybody else like doesn't know what
they're doing or not putting in the
effort it's basically like to try to jog
the productivity of your downline
because they're not doing sales or they
are not inviting enough or whatever you
know because hello that's the nature of
MLM business it's the people at the
bottom are just not going to be doing as
well overall as the people that were in
for seven years right so the upline gets
on and just yells at these people and
they're like I know what I'm doing I'm
working hard nobody else is working hard
it's alarming okay this video is no
different so yeah we're gonna be
attending our first Power Hour it's
gonna be it'll be wild it'll be crazy
it'll be yeah nothing new so let's just
get into it let's begin quick couple
things the main person is this person
who's ironically wearing a dare t-shirt
dare should also include
besides resisting drugs and alcohol
pyramid schemes but anyway we're
watching the person the Dare shirt the
red and the blue sleeves that's the top
upline person and by the way this is a
Beachbody Coach look they're always up
to no good you can always count on the
Beachbody Coaches to be up to no good
so no different today and she has an
interesting little henchman who makes
the video a lot more interesting who is
like I guess her probably second in
command and she's she'll know who that
person is
she's the waluigi to the Wario so here
we go you guys are so happy to be here
this makes me happy
but [ __ ] drumroll I love it sup
[ __ ] love it that's me never to hear
me yeah sweet all right what time is it

warm-up okay we're doing a warm-up with
the henchmen and uh I'm gonna do it I'm
gonna do it too I hope you're doing at
home I hope you're doing you know but
this is all to get geared up for a
pyramid scheme team call okay and what I
mean by that is your state of being your
state of mind if you're sitting there

family is telling me no and my husband

gonna start to happen whether you pull
energy from the universe or not okay and
I want you to remember right now and how
energized you feel and how positive you

telling you that you were gonna prove
somebody wrong and you want [ __ ]
pumps and you were ready now you've got
your hand on your tit you feel a little
little ridiculous right hell yeah
every single time you invite to this
business you're gonna feel [ __ ] weird

sit down now and relax I'm gonna keep my
hand here for a reason okay you feel
that way because that you believe in it
and you have something to give and you

isn't
slim-fast or Nutrisystem or Weight
Watchers or whatever [ __ ] is out

person that can prove you wrong is you

don't send an invite because of what
your dad's mom's sister's dog walker
might think about you keeps up [ __ ]
about that [ __ ] seriously how bad do
you want it let's work okay hmm
let's get to work ladies okay here's the
thing I feel like I've been helping you
guys play it safe by let's engage with
people
let's connect with people let's get my
team warmed up because inviting is scary
yeah well guess what
inviting is the only way you were gonna
grow this business the only way so guess
what we're gonna do for an hour invite
do [ __ ] else you're not gonna go and
scroll through people's feeds to say oh
my god well maybe they'd make a good
coach maybe I'll message them one day
you're not gonna go through and say you
know oh my god well maybe like how is
your job like what breed is your doubt
like we're not doing any of that
[ __ ] today because that is the
comfortable work I have come to the
conclusion based on numbers based on
strong facts based on strong results
that nobody's actually doing the work
right people are very comfortable adding
people to their network people are very
comfortable making connections people
are very comfortable posting on social
media sharing your journey and doing all
of those things and while those are all
great those are not making you money and
moving your business forward today how
many people are here to make money
it's not a bad thing okay but you have
to show up to this like it's your job
and no one is showing up to this like
it's their job okay so if I ever got on
a team call where someone was telling me
I'm not working and I'm not showing up
like it's my job talking to me this way
like so patronizing
I would exit out and cancel my Beachbody
just even being told this one time the
fact that no money clicks out for this
entire video astonishing to me you gotta
have more respect for yourself than just
sit there and let someone tell you
you're not working hard enough because
this is the thing people and MLMs here
like who are at the bottom levels here
all day long you're not working hard
enough you're not doing the right things
I'm doing more than you nobody's putting
in the work only me I would never let
somebody talk to me this way
just saying I love everyone on this team
I would not be here taking time away
from my family taking time away from my
kids I could be cooking dinner right now
I could be doing a lot of things but I'm
here investing my time energy and effort
into you guys because I believe that
every single one of you can do this but
guess what
2% of you are showing up and actually
doing the work that it takes again
saying 2% of you are doing the work that
it takes no guys you can't let people
talk to you like that you can't you
can't you can't okay
please have some more respect yourself
than that and this there's this false
premise that she's put forward here I'm
wondering if you caught it but she's
saying look I wouldn't be here right now
you know I wouldn't be taking time away
from my family I wouldn't be taking the
time out if I didn't believe in you guys
you know and it's like this fig thing
because first of all you would because
you rely on everybody below you in this
team call okay there's actually like two
more pages of people you can't see but
you rely on all these people so you're
here because you need these people to
work otherwise you don't make money okay
these people are your business and the
way you talk to them
is indicative of the way your business
is set up okay
the culture within your business these
are the people that you are relying on
and you treat them like [ __ ] I mean it's
this is the first few minutes of this
video and you've already told them that
they're not working and only 2% of you
even put in the effort like who wants to
hear that from their boss or you know
somebody that's higher than them I
wouldn't guess what that 2% is making
money that 2% is rank advancing that 2%
is showing up every single [ __ ] day
whether they feel like it or not because
they're treating this like it is their
job this business is hard guys I'm not
gonna sugarcoat it this business is hard
it takes time it takes effort it takes
energy and I need to do a better job of
showing that time effort and energy that
I put in before I earned the ability to
take a step back you see my lifestyle
now you see what I have now you see the
the freedom I have and the traveling I
get to do and you probably sign that
because you were like I want that for
myself yeah guess what
I worked my [ __ ] ass off for it I am
not exaggerating when I say that I was
in a shitty-ass relationship and this
was my escape I sat down headphones in
with the computer in my lap next to him
to show presence to be there with my
family because they didn't support it I
put my headphones in and I listened to
YouTube videos on how to grow my
business while sending invites I wasn't
listening to YouTube videos on how to
grow my business and connecting I wasn't
listening to videos and following people
I was literally sending out as many
invites as I could until I couldn't keep
my eyes open anymore and then around 2
o'clock in the morning I would go to bed
and then I would wake up at 6 do the kid
thing do the wife thing and then do it
again every single night guys I was
exhausted here's another thing I want to
point out so again these are all coaches
who said yes to the opportunity right so
these are all people that have been sold
something about this that they probably
likes but what did these people what
were these people probably likely told
they were probably told you can do this
in pockets of time do it at your own
pace
passive income side hustle right that's
that is what their pitched but then it's
interesting once you get into this team
call and these coaches and you're
talking to this person your upline she's
telling you you have to do this till you
can't even keep your eyes open anymore
and you have to do that every single day
so I want to just point out to you that
there is a very stark difference here
between what they tell you is the
reality of this business all pockets of
time whatever you want to do it Mahalo
and make money and then there's this the
reality which is you have to be sending
invites all day long all the time till
your eyes are believing if they heard
that how many people do you think would
want to sign up if you heard that right
it's just very interesting this is
something that you see because we're on
a team call where they think that this
is only Beachbody people watching them
so I think it's you know something that
be aware of if you're on the fence of
joining one of these things or you know
you're still not sure then you know keep
that in mind right yeah I was exhausted
did I make money straight out of the
gate six figures hell no it took me
years but I did the things every single
day for years I did not even take one
second of a day off not one second of a
day off boom mmm good some would say I
was obsessed some would say I went a
little crazy with it but guess what
it makes seven figures doing this [ __ ]
now and who gives a [ __ ] what they think
okay so I am asking you guys to make a
sacrifice for yourself I don't care if
your spouse support you I don't care if
your mom hates what you're doing you
shouldn't care either this is your
business okay and if you want to make a
change if you are not okay being
comfortable where you are then you have
to show up and I don't want to hear
excuses anymore guys it's it's
exhausting to me to have to get a
message saying well my dog was sick and
I had I don't care you should have been
sending invites from the [ __ ] vet
okay
I don't care if your dog's sick you
should have been sending invites from
the [ __ ] bet not only is that one of
the most heinous things I've ever heard
somebody say but for again it's this
stark difference okay between what
people are told about working this and
pockets of time do this whenever I just
work from your phone and it's kind of
like a passive easy thing and then
there's you need to be sending invites
while crisis is going on right there's
all these people that brag we saw in the
last video I'm so thankful I get to take
time away and just be with my family and
spend time with my family members and
and not have to worry about crisis and
taking time off but then there's this
your dog sick at the vet sick enough to
be at the vet and you should be sending
invites from the bed and everybody here
is complicit in this okay how how if I
hear that I'm click I'm exiting out you
guys you gotta have a little bit more
autonomy here than just sitting here and
taking taking this [ __ ] I mean you
have where's the meter here of like hey
that's not really something that you
should be saying it's like who wants to
live this life it's just that is
disgusting okay you should be ashamed of
yourself for saying something like that
it's disgusting Sunday I don't care for
dogs see you should be sending invites
from the vet she really shows how much
she cares about these people guys this
is the reality of it I'm I'm a good
person I started her I'm a good person
and I have peace I have to say that
probably arc and I have a big heart and
I'm only this passionate because I care
about your guys's success it is so hard
so hard and one day you will realize and
you will message me I remember on that
one Power Hour when you said this and
now I get it it is so hard to recruit
people to this business guys there's
twenty nine people on this call and
there's thousands on our team
[ __ ] thousands that alone is hard to
see but what's hard to see and hear is
recruiting people like you guys on this
call and hearing how bad you need this
to work your life is a mess you're
drowning in dread debt right you're
you're so sick with Crohn's or use
and you're miserable in your
relationship chips are terrible and all
of these things that you tell me when
you sign up right and then to sit back
for months and watch people half-ass
this when this is the answer and I god I
hope you believe that is it is so hard
to sit and watch people just half-ass
this business when it is literally the
answer to your problem
you just have this fear of being
successful or whatever whatever the [ __ ]
that even means yeah what does that mean
if you're being successful don't think
so so many people have a fear of being
successful right so many people have a
fear of being uncomfortable so many
people have a fear of what their
family's gonna think you are letting
that fear paw Paw's your success and
pause your future because guess what I
want you to close your eyes and think
about it a year from now if you keep
doing exactly what you did today where
are you gonna be a year from now exactly
what you did today just today how many
invites did you send how many coaches
did you work with how many new people
did you recruit if you did exactly what
you did today every single day for a
year close your eyes and where would you
be exact same spot probably so
patronizing you'd probably be in the
same spot because you're really not
doing anything not even moving forward
you don't even working hard two percent
of you're working hard people aren't
just putting in the work like how do you
listen to somebody tell it talk to you
like that really I'm shocked ma'am
probably okay I'm not asking you guys to
eat sleep and breathe Beachbody I did
and it worked for me she is kind of
asking people to do that I mean when
you're at the vet when your dogs sick
and you're still sending invites you're
you gonna probably get a problem yeah
but I'm asking you to give this a little
bit of effort okay that means getting
uncomfortable that means sending an
invite to the people that you need to
send invites to even though you don't
want to okay fast forward a year from
now where do you want to be are you okay
being in the exact same spot or are you
needing that to change that's what you
have to ask yourself and if you need it
to change stay on this call and let's
work and let's do some invites if you're
not ready and you're already pissed off
at me get the [ __ ] off the call okay I'm
over it Oh burn it guys really get the
[ __ ] off the car I mean this is a
business call from someone who I legend
Lee makes seven figures in the business
and we're being told to get the [ __ ] off
the car I know that it's like this weird
power trip kind of motivational strategy
that these people take or it's they
think they're like so badass and cool
but it's just not appropriate there's
holding people accountable but then
there's just this like this is just
belittling and patronizing and I don't
know how you could have respect for
somebody like this who talks to you like
she obviously has no respect for like
anybody on this call head off and I am
NOT gonna run with people anymore that
are slowing me down okay because I want
I would [ __ ] love for all 32 of you
to be like hit diamonds diamond in
October I [ __ ] did it I'd be like
[ __ ] let's have a 32 people party in
Denver
yeah I would love to do that
now make me do that okay let's [ __ ]
work let's send some invites not even
gonna walk you through an invite guys
you guys know how to invite okay I'm
over it I'm over it
you know how to invite you know who to
invite you need a place to start go to
Facebook and started a a okay Aaron's
gonna come up and he needs an invite
okay you've already gone through all of
Facebook go to Instagram and start it
one two three four Joan whatever the
[ __ ] their name is okay start inviting
people I don't care if you think they
would benefit from coaching or they
would benefit from a group I want you to
talk to them and I want you to invite
them okay everybody I'm gonna sit I'm
gonna do the exact same thing not even
gonna play music you want to chat if you
have a question please unmute yourself
literally I want you all to just sit and
do invites all day long now I am here to
help walk you through them yes if you
get in if you send an invite or you have
questions or messages in your inbox and
you have a question about one of them or
you need help with what to say to one of
them I am so happy to help okay
I'm you and please let me help you walk
through those conversations because
guess what as new coaches you really do
not have any idea how to talk people
okay you might think you do but you
don't so I want to help walk you through
those conversations hopefully you guys
can you know sense how manipulative that
statement is right there okay and it's
it's a conundrum that a lot of people in
MLM get caught in with their upline it's
it's just this very strange and
confusing dynamic that I can imagine is
happening because their upline is
telling them and acting like they are
just like this Messiah who knows more
this all-knowing savant that knows
everything about MLMs and how to be
successful and they hold the key to
these people's success cuz she's even
saying these people look just because
you're new you're just you're not gonna
know how to talk to people I know how to
talk to him so ask me the questions
right but it's like maybe these people
do they probably actually do know to
talk you know I'm saying it grabs a hold
of certain people I feel like this
dynamic probe
people from leaving because these the
upline acts like they know it all and
like they've got a secret to success
like some secret sauce that they're just
holding like they're dangling it right
over their head and I think it's very
damaging to these people because the
truth is these people don't hold
anything and don't really know anything
more than you do besides they got in
seven this girl got into seven years ago
okay seven years ago so things were
different then it's not that she's you
know you know better obviously she's
been doing it for more years but just
because she's been doing it longer
doesn't mean that she's any better than
these people
it's just inviting people it's not again
it's not like we're going you know we're
going into brain surgery here we're
sending hey girls on on Facebook okay
it's not that hard so it's just
manipulative it's patronizing yes
but guess what you have to start it with
an invite yes are we ready to work we're
ready to invite we're gonna be here
until six o'clock mountain time I'm here
to work with you guys so let's [ __ ]
work inviting starts now and it's gonna
be weird awkward silence
so just work okay one more thing before
the call gets to the weird awkward phase
where we all begin to start inviting
people on Facebook like as many as we
can we're gonna be inviting as many
people as we can that's the intent of a
Power Hour right so if there's ever been
a point in your life where you thought
you were like super special this person
in an MLM picked me to be one of their
business babes boss babes with them I
just want to let you know these people
say the same thing to just about a
hundred people a day okay I don't
remember if in this team call if they
talk about how many people they've
invited I think there might be one time
where they smell [ __ ] like oh yeah I did
I invited 60 people 120 like there was a
lot of different numbers I can't
remember though but
that's how many people they can invite
in an hour okay so it's a lot of people
so I just want to make it very very
clear if you've ever been on the fence
or if you've ever gotten a message and
felt like oh wow this person curated me
you know I don't want to make you feel
that because I know you're an awesome
person
you're the best okay the number one best
but they didn't pick it's not because
they think you're like amazing and you
have all these redeemable qualities and
you're gonna be better than everybody
else and you'd be perfect for the job
and you just popped into their mind and
they can't stop thinking about you like
I'm sorry but they've said that message
to about a thousand people and I know
that's obvious for some people but you
guys for some people it's not okay a lot
of people join these businesses every
day of thinking that they were the
chosen one right whoa chosen one it's
not the way it goes okay so we're gonna
go ahead and we're gonna invite about a
thousand people right now and we'll
catch you on the flip side okay so we've
been inviting for a while okay I have
been on tik-tok but so somebody asked a
question in the chat and the henchmans
gonna answer Ashley
rien vite always so if it's on social
media and they're still watching I'll go
back in three days later what's up still
watching my stuff why aren't you doing
this with me and I'll send a video of
myself saying that too in that tone of
voice if it's an email a week two weeks
three weeks four weeks but honestly I'll
follow up every week with somebody
because if they gave me their email it
means that they actually are interested
even a cut hair and you're an idiot if
you give your email to someone and don't
get spammed like I don't know what to
tell you
commit go all into this business be a
network marketer be okay with me
emailing people so I just meant like
they're in my Instagram they're not even
engaging my stuff but they're still
following me
so message I'm gonna be like literally a
video of yourself like video yourself be
like you know what's up I see you
watching all my stuff how can you not do
this with me yet okay they're gonna be
like oh my God thank you for sending me
a personal message save that message by
the way when you record the video and
send that to every single person that
keeps watching your stories because they
will think it's for them and it is for
them remember that thing I said about
look sorry but you're not that special
the proof is in the pudding sweetie so
so first of all is that somebody sent me
a yo what's up why'd you doing this with
me I would be so [ __ ] spooked I would
probably change my name in most states
that is so [ __ ] creepy and I wouldn't
I don't know who that's gonna work on
but maybe it's just I don't know maybe
I'm different maybe I'm different maybe
I'm a little bit of an oddball but
that's just creepy to me so then she's
like oh my god this is gonna work
because it feels like you know to that
person it feels like you sent that just
to them but then she says oh but by the
way save that and send that to everybody
so you can fake and pretend like you're
being authentic people are so dishonest
so your invite come with a couple of
different ways like if you're inviting
to a challenge group hey girl I am
starting a group on November 1st and
you're the first person I don't care if
you have to like the first person that
came to my mind I think you need to join
my accountability group I have it
starting in November first I'd love to
chat with you more about it I don't care
if you have to lie again these people
are so dishonest so dishonest there's
nothing I mean I'm sorry but please
don't fall for like I was chosen by this
person and who thinks I'm amazing
this is especially difficult when the
person that's contacting you is like
really good-looking or they're really
rich or you know that's like the allure
of the
lems is like oh my god this really
attractive person who's got their life
together thinks I'm gonna be the next
big thing and you cannot fall for that
because they've sent that same message
to a thousand other people that day so
here's a really interesting part of the
video so the henchman says can she do
responses so these people are now it's
like asking the group they're inviting
and then they're getting like negative
responses or like objections that
they're trying to overcome so this girl
is telling them what to do how to get
over certain things can I do responses
please please yeah I would love for you
to do that go girl okay every person is
going to message you with some nonsense
whether they have a chronic illness or
not us with chronic illnesses are gonna
send you the most nonsense because we
identify with it until we learn not to
anymore
so I would write back to that oh man so
does my coach I would love to give you
more info about how this lifestyle has
completely changed both of our lives
what's a good email to reach you at
probably easier there
I like they literally can write back to
me unless they write back to me that
they are unable to eat and breathe then
I'm inviting them and saying oh I'd love
to give you more info and I'll put like
a little thing at the beginning if they
write a sob story just because I'm not
an awful person because I remember that
my first message that was I can't do
this so like I remember that but I'm
also like why limit yourself I'd love to
give you more info just a conversation
what's a good email to reach you at okay
mmm the thing that scares me about this
is you know she's this person obviously
has like a very I don't give a [ __ ] I'm
unfiltered I'm an edge Lorde attitude
which is fine I think you can be an edge
Lorde like in your personal time but
like when it comes to business maybe
don't say these certain things like the
only way I'm not gonna invite somebody
as if they're telling me that they're
not they candy and they can't breathe
like that's just a I mean you have to
recognize that that's a very
inappropriate thing to say and to be
advising other people because obviously
this person is in a position in the in
the company I don't know where she is
exactly or what her ranking is but like
these people all below her so they're
all like okay she's doing something and
she knows something that maybe I don't
know and she's giving advice to people
on how to get over things and she's just
so inappropriate like you should never
run a business this way talking like
this and it's very scary to me that you
can say you know certain things about oh
I have a chronic illness and I see this
all the time by the way I have a chronic
illness blah blah and these people will
still push you and try to get you to
join in fact they like when they see
that you have a chronic illness because
then they think that they can use that
and say oh yeah my coach has that or oh
this changed my life and oh this balance
something and they'll make
unsubstantiated claims that are
oftentimes illegal by the way according
to the FTC but they'll make these claims
to try to reel you in and it's just
disgusting so here's another this girl's
gonna handle another question some no I
don't want to buy your products okay
well [ __ ] you then just don't say that
okay listen everyone's gonna tell you
they don't have money because everybody
has the money they all just got denied
it's not that they like don't have money
they're following you on Instagram which
is a free app that's only downloadable
onto a smartphone so they have [ __ ]
money it's not like they're at the
public library falling okay so call
themselves out on the [ __ ] you to
this idea this this thing that these
people have latched onto like oh you're
on an iPhone you're on a thousand dollar
smartphone you're on a you know whatever
so therefore you must have the money to
join my pyramid scheme know the one
thing of advice that I was given before
I started working at Sephora which
always helped me and I think it's just a
great thing in life if you're in sales
is to never determine somebody's budget
for them right so you should never
assume somebody has more money than they
do you should never assume somebody
doesn't have money who might have money
it goes both ways you can never assume
that people have money just because they
have an iPhone so this next one though
this next part is wild um first of all
someone that has cancer guys like I
don't have cancer but I have chronic
illness and this has helped my health I
know that FDA doesn't claim it I don't
care this has helped my health
significantly I mean so guys this can
help people and if someone has cancer be
kind but also still invite that but
here's the thing she has cancer and that
alone is why she needs to be doing this
that alone that's weak guys so much
stuff is related to the way we're eating
like if you didn't hear Carl and Isabel
talk about it on stage about how we're
exposed to all kinds of [ __ ] by
walking outside like inhaling this and
things in our skin in her mind in her
body and all these Rays of this and UV
it all this [ __ ] the reason she needs
this is because she has cancer that's
what you say to people
are these two scummiest people on earth
let me know are these the two scummiest
people on planet earth first of all
neither of these two people are a doctor
neither of them are health professionals
not even close and did you notice what
the one girl said in the red she said
did you listen to Carl on stage talk
about this their CEO so all of this
information they're getting is the CEO
is telling it okay I'm gonna say this
again leave people with cancer alone
please please leave cancer people alone
please please don't bring somebody with
cancer into your pyramid scheme where
less than 1% of people are gonna turn a
profit
please don't scam people with cancer
okay please don't please don't make
people with cancer who already have
crazy medical bills pay for workouts and
that could be and should be free okay
free free okay
I'm YouTube check it out on YouTube free
okay free nutritional advice free okay
people give that out for free nothing
Beachbody offers is necessary and that's
obvious right and that's obvious so this
is the this is one of the more
deplorable things that I've ever heard
people say and I don't think you would
be able to hear this unless you got a
hold of one of these kind of team calls
just saying this is what goes on when
all the doors are closed and they think
nobody's watching it's just the inner
group right what the [ __ ] is going on so
many people come to me all the time and
I'm sure Lindsay gets the same thing I
have Crohn's I have you see I don't know
if I get this is that's you need this
because you have do not even hesitate to
say that guys people need to hear that
too many people are like what's this
pill I can take to cover this up or
maybe I'll go what's this shake you've
got cuz it might help
No you need this because you have that
illness and that disease isn't there
anybody else you can take money from
besides people who are chronically ill
anybody else that you could sell to no
really that's your pool of people
you can't find healthy people to do this
disgusting disgusting you should be
ashamed of yourself
I get sick watching [ __ ] like this and
every single week I don't think that
[ __ ] like this can come out of people's
mouths and it does and I'm just sitting
here like how does this come out of
people's mouths
how do people think of this up I
couldn't dream this up if I wanted to
disgusting okay
recognize that so to follow that one up
we've got another great clip from our
fearless leader so if you are on my team
and running a free group I don't know
where the [ __ ] you learned that but you
need to unlearn it right now okay here's
the thing
free groups do not work they are going
to of your time effort and energy that
could be spent showing people valuable
things like your workouts and your
Shakeology and your nutrition plans and
all of these things and creating value
because guess what if you're inviting
enough people that price isn't gonna
matter so why the [ __ ] are you offering
a free group all these people down here
can I speak directly to you please why
are you still on this call why are they
on this call I don't know where the [ __ ]
you learned that we need to unlearn it
somebody spoke to me that way
you don't want to know okay here's
another favorite part of this call one
of the girls gets blocked you got
blocked me
so can I ask you are using quick replies
are you copying and pasting um I'm using
quick replies but I've been going
probably for two hours before this
nevermind
good job good job good job
so here's another little clip I like you
guys also have Facebook right so like I
was doing Facebook and I got blocked a
few hours ago so then I went to
Instagram and then I got blocked so I
went back to Facebook like [ __ ] you
algorithm okay then I got blocked from
both and guess what I did a sauna there
is always something to be doing if
you're doing
I promise you so she says she got
blocked on Facebook and Instagram right
the reason why I showed that is because
I think that getting blocked is almost
seen at least in this group but I've
seen it in other MLM groups too is like
a sign of oh that's an achievement
I got blocked I'm doing I'm going so
hard I got blocked right and at least in
this group it seems to be an achievement
they're all celebrating getting blocked
and she's thinking like oh I'm such a
badass I got blocked but I think getting
blocked is an indicator that you're
doing something wrong on the platform
like you're misusing the platform and
you're abusing you know relationships
and boundaries and certain things like
that right I think what they're talking
about like getting blocked from Facebook
and having to move over to Instagram
then they're not talking about like
getting blocked by one person I think
they're talking about like they're
getting sort of temporarily suspended
off of Facebook and so that's why
they're moving over to Instagram so I
think that's very weird
I know Facebook and Instagram have
certain mechanisms where they can detect
when people are adding too many people
in a certain time that it's built in
there because you're not supposed to be
doing that right so anyway this girl is
going to talk about it in a second here
too so a quick question your gufu form I
jumped over to it real quick because I
got blocked on Instagram and Facebook so
yours is multiple things the one that I
have it will only let me put tin so
here's another great clip let's watch it
you guys see me laughing right okay
every time I learn something at Tony
Robbins as well as priming I'm gonna
teach it to you right now when you get a
response and it's some [ __ ]
I want you to plug your nose and this is
literally Tony Robbins stood on stage
and did this and this is like why if you
watch in the call you see Carly's face
she's probably cracking up cuz she's
reading it doing she was there okay
this is what we hear when somebody
messages us when a grown up message is
this no thank you thanks for thinking of
me but I'm I'm really good with my roots
no no okay so like that's why I laugh so
that's what you need to do instead of
getting frustrated or annoyed or oh my
god in order see only this person
doesn't care
about their health nobody cares about
their health okay just look at it and
write back oh are you sure cuz I'm
having the most fun and I would love to
share more info with you about what I do
so her advice is to mock the person
that's told them no Mock the person that
they told him no huh
necessary her advice by the way that she
gives on a team call to all these other
people below her gotta love it yep these
people are super nice super cool would
love to hang with them any day of the
week this is the closing clip from our
fearless leader so let's watch this has
to happen in the privacy of your own
home with your dog on your lap with your
kids running around like [ __ ] crazy
with your husband rolling his eyes
because he doesn't support this says it
has to happen through all of that too it
can't just happen by weekly on a Power
Hour
okay it can't it has to be an every
single day thing and unless you are
willing to force it to being an everyday
thing to making it a priority to
sacrificing guys listen to this
#NAME?
to make this work it's not gonna work
guys I didn't go to family events so
that I could sit and work my business I
didn't go to birthday parties so I could
sit and work my business I didn't go to
pool parties with my family I didn't do
this I didn't do that I gave a lot uh
and the fact is that a lot of you aren't
willing to do that yet but until you are
willing to do those things your business
isn't gonna be where you want it to be
so this is a nice full circle piece here
because she's saying look you got a
sacrifice and take his time away I
didn't get to go to pool parties like
who cares but I think it's got a family
event I had to sacrifice all this stuff
and she's saying if you don't sacrifice
your business is not gonna take off and
you guys aren't willing to do that like
these people just sat on here for an
hour with these goofballs
okay what do you mean they're not
willing to do it they set out here for
an hour
inviting till they got blocked right
they just put in an hour of work right
here with no guarantee of pay right but
it's again this false narrative that
these people push to try to get you to
join small pockets of time side hustle
do this work when you want when you want
I don't have a boss I can do things when
I want to do it and I can make a full
time income still I can make side money
whatever passive income right these are
all things that make it seem like it's
gonna be easy
and then you get on this call you're
already a coach this is the reality you
signed up you paid the hundred and
eighty dollars whatever it is to become
a coach and then this person tells you
look you will never be successful unless
you sacrifice it all right that is the
reality that's what you see when you
become one of these people not before
they don't say this to you before you're
going to
sacrifice right we do not say this to
before so anyway I just want to make
that very clear you know if there's
still people who are on the fence here
because you know what a lot of people
are still joining [ __ ] Beachbody
money these people these businesses
right now during this pandemic are
having some of the best months that was
probably the one of their best q 2 q
ones that they've ever had you know I'm
saying so so seeing the reality of these
things is more important now than ever
right so anyway I hope you guys enjoyed
this video that was like a behind the
scenes look you know we just did our
first power hour together many more to
come hopefully but yeah I hope you found
this again you know educational send
this to your friends share it and like
this video if you liked it don't forget

for watching and have a good day
She said 'Oh my god! you got scammed!'
"So immediately, I was like 'what?!'"
So I moved back to Nairobi about 3 years ago.
"I had an incident, where, I think it was just"
"one of those random days in the afternoon, I got a call"
and this individual
started speaking in Swahili. He asked me for my name. I said
what my name was. He said 'we're calling from Safaricom
and we have a few questions we'd like to ask you
I didn't expect it was a scammer or there was a problem
So I go ahead and I give the details
"They ask me for my passport details, I gave."
"So as they're asking,"
"at the back of my mind, I'm like 'okay,"
why are they speaking to me in Swahili?' and I'm speaking in English.
Eventually
"he asked me certain details and I thought 'okay, this seems genuine.'"
"So they asked me, they had my"
serial number. The actual serial number that I used to buy the
the Safaricom line.
and I go ahead and they ask me my birth details.
The month and the year. And I give it.
I even gave my pin number. I remember very well.
"And then, after I hang up, I leave"
my room and I go and tell my sister.
'I just had a very weird call right now from Safaricom'
She said 'what were they asking?' I was like 'they were asking me for my
birth details and I gave my passport number. She said
'Oh my god! You got scammed!' So immediately I was like ' what?!'
"She's like 'yeh, you got scammed! Call Safaricom immediately!'"
So I called Safaricom
and I explained to them the situation and the good thing
is I had the number of the individual that called.
So I gave Safaricom the number and they explained to me that it wasn't them.
They confirmed that it wasn't them. It turned out that it was
an individual in one of the
Kenyan prisons called Kamiti.
and then I was like 'oh my god!' So they advised me that
'this is what you need to do' I had to change my pin code immediately.
"And basically, this was my"
first and I would say my last.
I still receive those calls. But now I know
since I installed Truecaller
it has made my life easier
"in terms of, now I can detect who the caller is"
and I don't pick up certain calls where I don't know
who the individual is. So far I've had a spam-free experience.
the phone scam trapping Americans with a
single word Authority safe begins as
soon as you answer the phone voice on
the other end asking can you hear me
once you answer yes that's all they need
investigators say they are recording
your answer for a reason
ABC's chief business correspondent
Rebecca Jarvis out to protect your money
tonight the new government warning of a
growing phone scam can you hear me okay
Teresa Thomas says she got the call at
home in Minneapolis
she was giggling and she said oh I
didn't expect you to pick up can you
hear me seems innocent enough but here's
how it works you pick up the voice on
the line asks can you hear me when you
answer yes the scammer is recording and
can use that yes to authorize future
charges
Teresa was lucky if it sounds fishy hang
up and don't provide any information of
course about you tonight experts urging
caution don't answer calls from unknown
numbers take advantage of any free Robo
call blocking service from your phone
carrier and report suspicious numbers to
the FCC David one more possible red flag
in this scam the caller asks if you want
to be added to the Do Not Call Registry
the government will never phone you to
ask this question just hang up David

the background I'm going to try and
contact that person to see if I can stop
them from getting scammed okay this is
just a follow-up to that this is just a
follow-up I heard another phone number
in the background while I was talking
with the scammer Alex so I let that call
with him end I called the other phone
number and there was some sweet old lady
on the line he was getting scammed and I
had to call her a few times to get her
to answer the phone but when she did she
said she thought she was getting scammed
but she didn't know what to do so now
she's gonna hang up with them and not
give them any information and that's why
we do this and that's why these videos
need to be shared with people so that
they know this kind of stuff is
happening all the time this is the only
way we can stop this because the police
and the government's can't stop it
because there's just too many of them
educating your friends and your family
is the only way to stop it in large
numbers so I don't care if you share
this video with your friends at least
just tell them that whenever they get
calls like this to just hang up and
ignore them Sam once again thank you for
letting us hit 2500 subscribers and
thanks for watching this long video
can you just tell me your first and your
last name so that i can just check that
what is wrong with you
and why service canada is calling you my
name is george mussler
okay so mr maslow i have your file in
front of me now
and as i can see service canada have
found five allegations under your name
within an arrest warrant issued under
your name so do you have any kind of
information regarding that case
nope that's the first time i hear about
it okay so mr george as we proceed
further i would also like to verify that
i'm talking with the right person can
you just verify me with your postal code

information of the case to you
yes l583y5 okay so mr george now i want

confirm me my back id and the case id
that i told you
goc 411 and amc
701 can you just tell me the name of the
street
kind of crescent okay okay so mr maslow
now as for the investigation report
under your social insurance number
service canada have found five
allegations under your name
your insurance number has been used in
the city of montreal
service canada and law enforcement
agencies have found
five bank accounts running under your
name in the city of montreal
and these accounts are indulged to
receive and transfer funds for illegal
and criminal activities like money
laundering and drug trafficking
this is the reason so we are calling you
because we have a case under your name
mr maffler of drug trafficking and money
laundering
so do you have any information regarding
that
no that's the first time i hear about
this and that doesn't sound good
okay we also think that this might be a
case of identity theft and someone might
have been using
your identity in the city of montreal
and we need to find the criminal who has
been using your identity
to do the criminal activity so before so
i transferred all the information to the
rcmp department
so now sir can you just tell me in
squash your bank do you have a checking
account or a saving account
i have both you have both
and can you just tell me the approximate
balance you are holding in your checking
and saving
so that i can differentiate between the
fake bank accounts and the real one
owned by you
okay um a five digit amount in my
savings account and four digit amount in
my checking account
okay okay no problem so you can just
tell the balance to the police officers
then they will call you dividing to your
case so now so
as i told you that we need to find the
property who has been using your
identity
can you just provide me the number for
the rcmp department let me advise
you okay it shows
rcmp in etobicoke
and there is a number there
nine zero five four zero five
three seven five zero
yes okay okay
so now what i'm going to do i'm just
going to call the rcmp department on
your behalf
and i'm just going to tell them that
there is a problem with your insurance
number which is under your name
so now what you have to do you just need
to hold the line for three to five
minutes
let me have a word with the police
officer and let me get back to you with
the resolution that they can provide for
your case to resolve the case from your
side
okay sir so i'm just gonna call the
police officer with my another line so
you need to
do that you do not need to disconnect
the line or put me on hold on mute as i
told you this is a correct line
we need to show this recording in the
courthouse okay
hello yes i'm here yes sir yeah i just
have a word with the police department
and the officer told me that before
providing you any resolution they need
to have a word with you directly
so they would be calling you with the
same number that you provided me for the
rcmp and the same neuron which i
tracked them all the details of your
case so when you receive the call from
the department
you need to have a work with the police
officer till the time you are having a
walk with the police officer
you need to put me on hold
yes they will call you and you need to
put me on hold and have a walk with the
office
okay they're calling me now hello yes
yeah george speaking uh hi
george the head office and dean campbell
from the rcmp department
i just got an information by the service
camera regarding to your social
insurance number so did you have what we
just service canada
yes okay and what did they exactly told
you
that perhaps i'm a victim of identity
theft or something
um some bank accounts
now see mr george see we have right now
case under your name of money laundering
and drug trafficking
see as investigative team of csis
and service canada is telling us that
this is not not being done by you
then and then only we are trusting you
in their words okay
so right now serving how to
differentiate between the fake bank
accounts running under your social
and the genuine money you have okay so
just tell me right now which bank you're
dealing with
scotiabank i told that already to the
other person
i didn't know you you didn't told me
okay can you just help me with the
approximate balance you're holding your
scholarship as i told the officer there
i i'm kind of like cognizant that i do
not want to share
exact amounts so i have a five digit
amount in my savings account and four
digit amount in my checking account
sir i need to approximate balance like
five thousand ten thousand twenty
thousand
that's the reason i'm asking you what is
the amount you have okay
so it's around 11 000
in my savings and about 5 000 in my
checking
okay and so what do you do for a living
can you just tell me
right now i'm unemployed okay well

any
information to any thought person in
michigan
i'm sorry i'm sorry what was that with

insurance number or any other identity
in mississauga
other than the bank other than the bank
nobody
and also have you lost your identity
before
have i had what sorry have you lost your
identity before george
not that i can think of can you just
tell me the officer name and the bad id
from the service canada
ready he said officer don
and the badge number was goc
i think and what was his first name
harry harry something like that and
what's the case id
don't you have that information already
or am i supposed to provide it
say that's you're supposed to provide it
i need to verify like did he have all
the information on us amc
701 i think okay
okay i got it i got it right
okay well george see i just seen like
here
like somebody else has got an access to
your social insurance number
and that person is trying to defund the
government under your identity
seizures right now what we are going to
do we are going to shift to you
under the new social insurance number
okay
so you will be getting a new social
insurance number
with the help of the service canada are
you getting it
okay now george
in order to provide you a new social
insurance number
we have to suspend your current social
insurance number
and once you do that then whatever
information which is linked to your
social
life your bank accounts your credit
cards your debit cards are gonna be
plugged
and taken away by the government that
means the money which you're holding in
your bank accounts will be blocked and
you won't be having any access to your
bank accounts
so first suspending your social
insurance numbers george i need to ask
this from here
you like do you want to save god the
money that you're holding in your bank
account
or is that okay for you to make that
money block and season fees under the
government
sorry what do you mean freeze by the
government
sure uh see once we suspend your social
insurance number
the bank which you say that you are the
owner of you also gonna be club
and you won't be having any access to
that pot of money or that part of
information well
since you're telling me that i have an
issue i'll go right now to scotiabank
and withdraw my money
so that's what i was asking do you want
to save god your money or not
of course i want to save my money okay
now see george there are three steps
which you need to follow in order to
save god your money
okay okay now first step you can just
write it down
you can describe it in a piece of paper
so you can just script up each and every
information
okay okay of course it's george as you
know that your bank accounts are gonna
be plugged
any minute from now so first step what
you have to do you need to go to what's
your bank and you need to withdraw the
money from your bank account okay
okay now once you withdraw the money
from a bank account
see right now you are the one who is you
know accused for the case of
money laundering and drug trafficking
and under the money laundering and drug
trafficking case
george you're not authorized to keep any
cash with you
above 100 because if you elect withdraw
the money from the bank and if you try
to keep that money with you
and in the meanwhile if any government
agency is rated your property
and they found that much amount of money
with you they're gonna take that money
from you consider
considering that money as a black mini
and they can also take you behind the
parts
so george just to keep you on a safe
place see what
me and my department is going to do my
department will be creating a safety god
wallet for you
which you will be getting on your text
message
and it will be like a bar code or a qr
code are you getting it
okay now
once you complete the first in a second
step like that means once you have your
safety got one
and once you withdraw the money from
your thing so you need to
like convert your money into your safety
guard wallet
with the help of the bit which is known
as
bureau of income tax atm machine
now do you know what is the bi t80
machine
no okay now let me indicate you each and
everything like what is the bit
machine now and how it works just tell
me one thing sir
have you ever used a normal atm in which
you insert your debit card and you get
the money out
of course well same comes with the bic
machine sir the people from the service
canada will be you know
telling you the address of the nearest
b-i-t-a-t machine where you have to go
physically
and once you are at the bic machine
shirt the first step the machine will
ask you to do is
to scan your safety guard wallet
so first you need to scan your safety
guard wallet at the machine
now once you scan your safety got wallet
sir the machine will recognize you and
ask you to put your money into the
machine one by one
and once you are complete inserting all
your money into the machine sir
the machine will give you a proper
receipt of the transaction
you have made to your safety guard
wallet now
so once you converted your money into
your safety guard wallet you need to
make sure that you don't provide your
safety guard wallet to any thought
person
because tomorrow the two government
officials one from my department and one
from the service canada
are going to pay a visit at your
doorstep as per your comfortable time
and once they're at your doorstep sir
they will be providing you with a new
social insurance number
and they will be giving you all the hard
copies of your innocence that this is
not being done by you
and you're not a criminal now once they
give you
all the safer work and documentation sir
and you put your signatures on the
paperwork
see the officer from the service canada
will be rescanning the safety guard
wallet
and will be retransferring all the money
into your old bank accounts within your
social insurance number
automatically that's how you get your
money back you also get a new social
insurance number
and we are the ones who are going to
remove your name from this case of money
loan drink and drug trafficking
am i clear with this sir and what do i
need to do now
so i need to go to the bank now yes sir
but before that you need to talk to the
service canada
so sir i wish you all the best it was a
pleasure talking to you
and have a great day all right thank you
hello hello mr george
yes yes sir i just received the fact
from the rcmp department yet you have
just worked with them so can you just
tell me that
what kind of information and what is the
resolution that they provided you
that i need to go to a bitm machine
of sort and deposit my money in some
safeguard
safety wallet and can you just tell me
the officer name
and the patch id number so that i can
just update in the
file dean campbell i think it was
okay and did you wrote down the backside
did he tell you the bad side
754 rt68
okay okay now so what i'm going to do
i'm just going to transfer this line to
my senior officer
who will guide you with all the
procedures that what you have to do and
how you have to do
and they will provide you the safety
guard wallet which would be existed
under your phone number and your name
so you just need to hold the line let me
transfer this call to my senior officer
and then they will handle the situation
with you
okay okay so just hold the line you can
get back to you
[Applause]
hello yes yeah
yes yeah mr john they said officer ryan
cassidy how are you doing today
i've been better all right sir
i'm a senior officer at the
investigation department of service
canada
and i believe you had a work with my
junior officer could you just inform me
his name and his badge
officer harry don don harry one of the
things
okay
um amc 701 i think
so this may not be a bad idea this is
your
uh a restaurant or this would be a case
case id yeah i believe this is the case
id
i don't know like somewhere here in my
notes i've been taking frantic notes
here
okay sir no worries so you had a lot
with the police officer i believe from
the rtm
so what did he tell you to take my money
from the bank and put them in some
machine of sort
okay and that's it they told me that
you'll tell me more because i don't know
where to find that machine
yeah so i will be guiding you for that
but did you tell me something about your
new social issues number
because our duty is to give you provide
your new social insurance number by
securing your funds into the bit machine
which will be attached to a safety guard
wallet
that will delete with your phone number
and i believe it's four one six
eight nine zero four yes
that's my phone number but i don't
understand how you got my phone number
so we have received information from
service senior and we have been calling
you from
that only it's our duty i thought that
you are service canada
yeah okay
so so now we need to start with the
procedure
for this uh i hope you're ready to leave
your house so you want some time to get
ready
uh for what to go to the bank
yes sir you need to go towards your bank
can i do that tomorrow so you cannot do
that tomorrow
because tomorrow i will be paying you a
visit for your new social medias number
so that's why this position needs to be
done today itself
oh okay so i have i have to go right now
yes sir you can go to your bank right
now and i believe it's just
four to five minutes away from your
particular residence
you want me to send you the address
uh well
i i i know where the bank is if that's
what you're asking me
yeah so you you can if you're ready to
leave your house you can leave your bank
and you can go towards your brain
so i'll be waiting for you on the line
only the moment you reach back
yeah you need to have a word with me
before you enter the bank okay
i have an important information for you
so why don't you give me that
information right now
sure we cannot provide you that
information right now and i'm doing some
of your paperwork as well
so could you please leave your place and
go to your bank if you're already if
you're not you can do if you want
sometimes i'll wait for you
okay i was thinking to load the
dishwasher because i need to do that and
then i was planning to go to the bank
but if i need to go now
no way sir actually we want that to be
done right now but if it's too important
for you to
do that you can take your time i'll stay
on the call no worries
okay so if i need to leave now um
um i might lose you for a moment
so do i just call the number back or
have to keep me on hold you cannot call
me back you have to keep me on hold as
we told you that these lines are
recorded at least to be presented into
the courthouse for the
for your closure but what courthouse
i've done nothing wrong
we know sir that's why we're helping you
to give you a new social resource number
because the older one is being misused
and you have my social insurance number
sir we do not have your social issues
number
this is a transfer call and you're not
supposed to talk about numbers over this
call
sir and it's my duty and it's i am also
having a job and i need to get this
procedure done today itself
so rather than be confused in this if
you have a word you can do your work
other than that if you can leave for the
bank
okay so i will go and i will go and get
my car
and i'll call you when i'm at the
you need to stay on this bank as well
you can just keep me on hold you can
keep this one in your pocket but you
cannot hang up the call due to some
security reasons
security reasons sir are you
wanting to go through the procedure or
not well
because we do not have a complete time
and we have we are questionable to our
superior officers as well
so we cannot decide things on our bases
on our with our consent

Christina please."
"You're speaking
with a journalist from CBC,"
"Canadian television, and I'm
trying to understand why you"
keep stealing money from people.
Why do you keep doing this?
"[David] The people that
you have stolen money from."
"The people you are stealing
thousands of dollars from."
"-Why do you do that?
[Beeping]"
"[David] She hangs up, not
wanting to answer our questions."
"But back in India, whistleblower
Jayesh reveals why the bank"
"investigator scam
is so successful."
"[David] But with that
bank investigator,"
they're still targeting Canada?
"-Yeah.
-[David] Why?"
Because the data is available.
"[David] He says Canadians share
a lot of personal info online,"
"making it way easier to
find targets"
and sound convincing.
"[David] If you wanted to
start a scam centre today,"
"Jayesh, how easy would it be?"
"I'll buy five systems,
laptops, one server computer,"
"okay, I'll hire five people,"
"I'll buy leads, one
number costs"
"two rupees, okay?"
"[David] So, it's very cheap
to get into the scam business."
"Very cheap,
very cheap."
"So, with 2 dollars
I get 100 names,"
"numbers, everything."
"Now I'll give them to
the people I hired,"
"okay, and they start dialling."
And the game has started.
"[David] The unwitting players
in that game are Canadians being"
"told their bank
accounts, their identity,"
is in danger.
You want to see more warnings.
"Absolutely.
The buck stops at the banks!"
"[David] This is a
guy who's wondering,"
"why when he went to the bank,
why no one said, ""Ahmed you've"
"never done this before."""
"""Are you being scammed?"""
"That's a good question,
especially with someone"
borrowing the funds.
"At that point, that bank
representative should have been"
"asking him ""Are you comfortable
with what you're using this for?"
"Can we help you
in some other way?"""
"[David] And what about
specifically warning there are"
scams doing just this?
"Absolutely, that's where we
want the banks to be saying to"
"customers, ""Just to let you
know, we've seen"
"this type of thing before."""
"If you're asked to send money
and you're pressured by someone"
"you've never met
in person before,"
"something's not lining up here,
let's all take a step back here"
"and consider whether this
is legitimate or not."
"[David] Canada's big banks
are represented by the Canadian"
Bankers' Association.
"They tell us ultimately
the customer is responsible."
"But they say staff are trained
to ask probing questions if a"
"client makes an unusual
transaction."
"And Ahmed's bank, RBC, says they
have ""sophisticated monitoring"
"systems and controls"" and
they can ""proactively contact"
"clients"" to confirm
certain transactions."
"Still there is no requirement
forcing banks to warn people"
"like Ahmed and he
says no one did."
"Ahmed knows he'll likely never
see his money again but is glad"
just to be heard.
"Why are you sharing
your story with us now?"
"Basically, to tell people, to
tell people that they should not"
walk into this kind of a trap.
"[David] We're going to keep
investigating these phone scams"
and we want to hear from you.
"Have you paid money to a scammer
claiming that you have unpaid"
"taxes or that your bank
account has been hacked?"
"Maybe your computer
needed a quick fix?"
"Let us know.
marketplace@cbc.ca."
We're going to stay on the case.

Hello.
"""They are planning to arrest you for seven months"
"to jail now."""
Students are receiving scam calls at an alarming rate.
You can recognize when you are speaking with
a scammer by listening for clues.
"""The total and final outstanding balance"
"of your name all together is $9,750."""
U.S. government agencies will never call
you to demand money.
They will not contact you by phone to let
you know they are coming to arrest you.
"Scammers claim to be calling  from many U.S. agencies,"
"including local police departments,  USCIS,"
Department of Homeland Security
or even the IRS.
"""The degrees that you received in your name in"
December 2017 will now have no more values
"on it. On behalf of your  education, no"
job or admission will be granted to you
"in the premise of the United States."""
Government agencies cannot take away
the degree you have earned.
Scammers may use any threat they can to scare you.
"""The student will need to go into the IRS office of their"
"city personally, individually, by themselves,"
"without involving their parents, CP, or lawyer,"
"tax person or H&R Block office."""
Scammers get paid by scaring you into believing
"you will be arrested, or worse,"
if you don't give them money.
They can sound very convincing and official.
They may even be appear to be calling from an actual
agency when you Google their caller ID.
Don't be their next victim.
I'm glad I didn't fall for that.
"If you receive a call you suspect is spam,"
do not give them any personal or financial information.
End the call immediately and hang up.

you
howdy folks happy Halloween got a raisin
played out nothing too scary though
although when you're opening a hard
drive you can always get scary anyways
what I'm doing this video on today is
not about the hard drive it's kind of a
good news day here in Canada I don't
know if anyone's heard but apparently
there was a big police raid of a bunch
of those scamming call centers in India
you know the ones who claim to be from
Revenue Canada and you a bunch of money
basically the scam goes some guy who
claims he's an officer of the Revenue
Agency and that you made a mistake on
your taxes and you still owe a bunch of
money and the cops are basically coming
to take you away unless you pay it right
away and you have to pay it to this dude
on the phone and they usually want some
kind of weird form of payment and gift
cards or Bitcoin you know something
really you know suspect but you know the
first time I got one of those calls yeah
you know you get scared when if the cops
are coming for you
even if you know it's a mistake you
can't you think they won't geez what
kind of BS is this but anyways so they
caught a bunch of these buggers there's
still lots of them out there apparently
so it's not that you can avoid getting
any more of these but it's good knowing
that it's that they're finally catching
these guys cuz I kept thinking why can't
they catch these buggers right so
anyways you know after you get one or
two of those you you know exactly what
they're all about and you can start
having fun with them factors are really
there's a really funny video online I'll
link to it up in the little card doodad
up in the corner down in the description
here it's it's a guy a really funny
fellow who you know he's taking this guy
for a ride for
one time oh the guy on the end of the
phone the scammer he gets so upset but
it's really funny so you think you're
all out of it but this morning I
actually got another one and this was
completely different and we'll go
upstairs and listen to the message it
was early in the morning woke my wife
and I up but I think it was 6 a.m. and I
just want to put it out there so other
people know about this one too didn't
heard of this one before it's a credit
card scam we'll go upstairs and take a
look before getting to the phone message
here's the phone number that are
originated from anyone's interested -
five four two six four eight eight five
nine two five four is a Central Texas
area code I'm not saying this originated
from Texas so that's where it's from who
knows where it came from who knows so of
course it screams scam right but let me
tell you when they when you wake up to
that and here's something about three
hundred dollars and a thousand bucks on
your Visa card yeah you wake up pretty
quick of course when you listen to it
again yeah you know first thing she says
your card number starts with four or
five yeah every visa card I believe
starts with four or five if she would
have said the last two digits yeah I
would have been more suspect you know
one of the options there was depressed
to to cancel the charges now who knows
what would happen if he pressed - would
you be taken to a live person
would you be would it go to some you
know charge per minute type phone thing
you'd get billed for who knows but I was
you know I just phone my bank my credit
card provider just to just to make sure
and the service rep she checked
everything out she said there was not
even an attempt to make any charges to
my card and the one thing that was kind
of interesting though she did say it was
the third call she had gotten this
morning from the same phone number so
obviously it's a fairly prolific scam
that started and she wanted to record
the number as well so she could pass it
on to their investigations department
and that's why I'm throwing the video
out here just figured more people who
know about this kind of stuff the better
if you got one of these yeah it's just a
scam and figured they're spooky scam
phone call things or a good good video
there to put up on Halloween have a good
one
Mumbai is famous for the Gateway of India behind me
but it's also famous for a sympathy scam.
"People from the streets.. they come up to you and they ask you to buy them milk, rice and oil."
So they can feed their family or feed their little kids they're holding.
But it's all a sham because they just go and they resell that food straightaway.
And it is quite expensive. It can cost you up to 1500 rupees to buy those three items for them.
And basically it's business for them. I've seen them operating.
So let's go and fish a few of them out so you can see how to avoid this when you're in India.
Scammer: Baby milk. Karl: What do you want? Baby milk? Scammer: Yeah. Karl: No no.
Fan: I see your videos.
Karl: What?
"Scammer: Buy milk for baby. Karl: You want what? Scammer: Food. Karl: Food, milk?"

"Karl: Oh, this one's rice."

"There's one, two and three."

Nun: There is another rice. Karl: Yeah.
"Karl: Yeah, yeah. I know."
"Karl: It's okay. Let it be. Let it be. Thank you. Nun: Yeah, but these people cheat you all huh? Be careful."
Karl: I understand so...
So I'm just going along with it right now.
Nun: Why don't you go to Prem Dan? Karl: Prem Dan?
Nun: Prem Dan is a NGO which is run by the nuns.
"And her granddaughter, both the granddaughters, we are educating."
One is in Holy Name and another child is in..
"Both the grandchildren, we are educating. Karl: I understand. I understand."
I know what's gonna happen. She's gonna resell.
Nun: So what happens you know.. you must go through the proper channel.
"So these people just tell you do this, do this and then they take you for the round."
Karl: I understand. Nun: Yes.
Karl: Thank you so much. Thank you for your help. Nun: Yes. Nun is there
"Karl: Oh, lady is crazy, eh? Scammer: Yes. Crazy. Karl: Crazy lady."
Scammer: Can you buy oil? Buy oil.

This is good. Scammer: Buy milk. Karl: This is good. Scammer: Milk?
Karl: No. No milk. We've got rice. This is a big bag of rice to me. So much rice for you.
Scammer: Also buy milk? Karl: No. No milk. We got enough rice.
"It's like, how many kgs of rice? 5 kgs of rice. Scammer: 5 kgs."
"Also buy oil.. cooking oil. Oil in rice cooking. Karl: Oil, yeah."

"Scammer: So you going to Prem Dan? Karl: No, I'm not going to Prem Dan. What is Prem Dan? I don't know."
Scammer: So that lady is crazy. Karl: Crazy lady.
Scammer: Crazy lady. Karl: Absolutely.
Scammer: Crazy lady and also people crazy.
Why.. telling why why. Karl: Mean lady. I don't trust her. It's okay. Scammer: Yes.
Karl: Thank you.
"No. No maps for me, buddy. I know India. Been to nearly every single state."
"Cool, eh?"
"Karl: Uh, no worry. No worry. Bye."
"Man: Nice kurta, brother. Don't buy this. Karl: Thank you so much."
"Karl: Hi there. Manager: Yes? Karl: You speak English, eh? Manager: Yes, yes."
Karl: There's some people outside and they bringing foreigners in here.
"And they're asking foreigners to buy rice, oil and milk. Manager: Yes."
Karl: What is happening? What are they doing/ What's the reason?
What do they.. do they resell it afterwards? Manager: They resell it.
Karl: Okay. So it's a little bit of a discount and they resell it. Manager: Yes.
"Karl: Yeah. They better donate to charity, maybe."
Not buying that 5 liter cans of oil. Karl: yeah. Manager: Very expensive.
Karl: Yeah. So they just sell that and get the money. Where do they sell it? Do you know?
Manager: Nearby shop. Local shop. Karl: Thank you sir.
Bye!
Bye!
How was that? The entire family was operating the scam.
"The mum, the daughter.. their kids were being used to gain sympathy."
And I found the husband. He was just watching over the entire operation.
This is just a business for them.
And they're at it every single day here.
"And Mumbai, if you want to help these people, donate to a charity."
"That's the best way to know that your money.. you know, that it's going to help the right people."
And my subscribers that I bumped into.. that was hilarious you guys.
Six or seven people I met while I was filming this scam video.
It's getting really hard to do this now.
"And that sister, who tried to help.. tried to get me out of that scam.."
"That is ""Guest is God""(athiti devo bhava). That is Indians butting in to help foreign guests."
So thank you to her. But you know I was filming this scam video so...
I just went. I pretended she's crazy and just went along with the rest of the video shoot.
"And if you're coming to India soon,"
I've got a quick start safety guide available in indiasurvivalguide.com
"If you had read that already, you would have known about this scam."
So go check it out.. indiasurvivalguide.com. Jai Hind!

it'll take a brave or a stupid
journalist to ever hack a phone again
but international fraudsters are just
getting started
their motive not snooping but stealing
millions of pounds of other people's
money their victims are often low key no
big banks no multinational corporations
instead they single out places like this
a small corner of rural North Yorkshire
and its unsuspecting local council the
hit happened on Christmas Day people
were busy tucking into their turkey
dinners too busy in fact to notice they
were being ripped off by a new breed of
international phone hacker the target
was a District Council one of hundreds
of victims across the UK of a new scam
that's worth a billion pounds a year for
48 hours
the council's business centre was
hemorrhaging cash across three
continents attackers had hacked its
phone exchange forcing it to dial
thousands of premium rate numbers
numbers operated by the hackers
themselves each core netting them as
much as 10 pounds a time so the profits
soon mounted up as did the council's
phone bill they got into the system and
were dialing out to countries such as
Ethiopia and Pakistan and Bosnia on a
premium rate so how much were you hit
for thirty thousand pounds that is
public money and has to be paid by it by
the taxpayer why didn't you just not pay
we obviously have this contact with our
communications people and they tell us
that they'd actually had to pay the bill
to BT and we were liable because the
moment the money goes abroad there's no
way of clawing it back as a council in
South East England discovered when they
were taken for a hundred
thousand pounds in just five days as URI
communications are specialists in
keeping the hackers out so they know all
about the tricks they use so how as the
hacker do you get into the phone system
okay that's very simple you just need a
telephone and you can dial in so I'm
going to telephone into an exchange that
we've got set up nobody's going to
answer the call and we wait till it goes
to voicemail and that's where we get how
do we actually access the system from
there I've had a guess that the default
administrators password because people
haven't bothered to change it no it's
all set up exactly as it left the
manufactory so we're inside the system
then what well once I mean is the
administrator I have complete control
over the system and I'm going to
configure that mailbox so that next time
it receives a call it's going to dial
out to our international premium rate
number so all you needed the default
password to have complete control of
this phone system and to manipulate it
to make expensive calls to far-flung
foreign destinations absolutely yes and
so as a hacker I could then collect the
revenue from that premium rate number
when the calls come in of course it
takes an expert to know all the right
codes to enter and the hackers even have
"software that dials 10,000 numbers in"
our and cracks pass codes in seconds in
the UK where the world's third-biggest
victims and because the attackers are
scattered across the globe police
struggle to catch them once they've run
the fraud and once they suspect that law
enforcement are on to it they can make
their entire tracks disappear very
quickly indeed it's not going to be at
all easy to get the information that law
enforcement need without getting court
orders in multiple countries something
for which the resources are just not
there so we need government to actually
stand up and take action to put a
strategy in place because most of us
clearly don't own a phone exchange we'll
be
from this particular scam what we
probably do own is one of these and
those premium rate fraudsters and even
found a way of warning into our mobile
phones without us noticing they do it by
exploiting apps hugely popular computer
programs for mobile phones but thieves
are making fake versions download one
and you let a hacker into your phone
we've got an image of what's actually
happening inside the phone itself which
gives you an idea of any malicious
activity which is happening
nitin Litani works for the premium rate
regulator he's found a particularly
nasty fake disguised as several
sought-after games it swindled customers
in eighteen countries out of a quarter
of a million pounds in just a few days
so I think I'm getting the best-selling
game this out day right now so I'm doing
it for free I've downloaded it what's
actually been going on then in the
background if we have a look at the log
app is designed to send three messages
to a premium rate number and which would
instigate three messages coming back
which would be the chargeable messages
without me knowing it my phone is sent
out three text messages premium rate
text messages you have been built fine
pounds there so I thanks for each
message indeed
so that's 15 pounds in a blink of an eye
the phone user really wouldn't have any
idea that this has happened
absolutely the coating is designed to
actually suppress notification of any
incoming messages and it won't tell you
any of any outgoing messages this fake
app was removed and today in a first for
the UK every mobile user targeted will
get a refund no such luck for the
victims of phone exchange scams their
best bet is to change their pass codes
because the hackers are almost
impossible to trace Karen Jenkins

how to avoid being the victim of a scam

website channel for calm forward slash

hello hello hello
nice try [ __ ] this is the
[Music]
hey it's Neville here and today we're
gonna talk about how to scam people for
money now we all know the real key to
success is making great products and
putting a lot of hard work into them
 that we don't like this hard work
stuff so let's take the easy way to make
money and scam people into giving us
money instead now our goal here is to
deeply exploit human psychology and get
the most vulnerable and needy people to
fork over what little cash they have so
let's put our evil hats on and get
started
scam tactic number one make sure you
focus on a hopeful yet sort of dumb
crowd these are the people who think
internet riches are a push of a button
away these are the people who subscribe
to the idea that they deserve to live a
good life these are the people who dream
of finding a passive income source that
requires no work this will be our target
audience by the time we apply some fancy
copywriting and psychologies to these
gullible people they'll be willingly
handing over their money now this kind
of crowd doesn't understand that success
usually requires years of hard work and
effort they want the end result without
the hard work these people are generally
on the lower ends of Maslow's hierarchy
of needs they want the shortcut to
riches they don't want to hear about
hard work they just want to bypass all
that hard work and get straight to the
riches so let's fill these idiots up
with hope then drain their wallets of
cash we're gonna be using the target
psychological emotion of greed and
laziness on this one so now that we've
identified our target audience we can
start getting them to trust us through
simple manipulation scam tactic number
two show them how badass your life is
through pictures so we need to establish
that we are very authoritative and very
wealthy by showing them cool we've
done so we're gonna do this by showing
pictures of cool things they're broke
asses can't afford
if you take every cool thing you've ever
done in your life and shove it into a
few pictures your life seems awesome so
for example you're gonna show pictures
of yourself randomly flying in first
class seats you need to show pictures of
activities that poor people can't do but
you can because you're such a baller
like taking a zero-gravity private jet
flight or going to Burning Man and
renting a giant RV to do it you got to
show pictures of bank accounts with
random numbers in them the bigger the
better they don't have to be real just
make up random numbers these idiots will
believe us you got to show pictures of
you working from random places like this
working from a pool photo or working
from the laptop life photo or working
from a rock gym working from a beach in
Thailand working from a Harvard Club
office you get bonus points if you add a
bunch of hashtags and quasi motivational
 to the pitchers also these gullible
lazy bastards will think that were
balling out of control and know the
secrets to wealth this is because poor
people often equate cool and expensive
stuff with some form of wisdom dummies
we are exploiting the target
psychological emotion of proof and
credibility with this now let's move on
to scam tactic number three tell people
they deserve a certain lifestyle this
concept of people deserving a certain
lifestyle appeals directly to the most
hopeless and gullible of people you get
bonus points if you make them think a
certain lifestyle can be theirs only if
they believe this is what a lot of life
coaches do they pump people full of
belief with a rational logic but you
can't use rational logic to explain this
you need to use vague quotes preferably
coupled with stock photos of people
jumping for joy or running through a
field like this live the life you
deserve this is a random picture we took
off a Flickr Creative Commons and this
quote we made it up it's not even real
and what about this one
it's a picture of a random little girl
running through a field with a fake
quote from Bill Clinton that says when
pursuing your dreams age doesn't matter
that's how you're a real quote we just
put that there people who are very
hopeless tend to flock to vague yet
plausible sounding advice like this it
gives them hope it makes them trust you
it makes you seem like an inspirational
figure
it makes them dream of the output of a
successful business of course it just
conveniently inspires them but never
actually teaches anything valuable yes
suckers these kind of vague images and
quotes directly hit the rewards part of
their brain it fuels their desire to
belong to an elite club where they do
little work have lots of leisure and
make tons of money this is exploiting
the psychological emotion of desire to
belong and desire for freedom now let's
go down to scam tactic number four don't
ever get into the specifics of how you
make money just give businesses sounding
advice you see since we're going after a
very hopeless audience we don't want to
give real business advice that stuff is
too hard and working tensive for them to
care we have to give them business e
sounding advice like this failing is the
first step to succeeding by shinzou
Miyake Suzumiya key isn't even a real
name I just made that up off
photoshopping the image but who cares
these idiots will never research it
these people don't actually want to do
work but instead they want to play
entrepreneur so you need to make success
looks like it takes two hours a week can
be done from anywhere in the world and
always returns usual wards they don't
want to see hard things that work stuff
scares them off they want to see that
you've figured out some push-button
solution that will solve all their
problems and we're exploiting the target
psychological emotion here of hope now
let's get on to scam tactic number five
always show huge numbers no matter how
irrelevant they are make sure you add
tons of numbers wherever you
can it doesn't matter what the context
is for example you can say
this website has over 1 million views
now the real translation that only you
and me know about is in the 10 years of
running this website my Google Analytics
shows 1 million total page visits which
equates to less than 90 unique visitors
per day just let them assume these
numbers are meaningful like this you say
my last product launch generated seven
figures
the real translation is over the course
of three years selling this product the
total revenue generated was nearly 1
million dollars but I only made 75
thousand dollars of profit on it I just
want you to assume that quote unquote
million dollar number means profit you
see the realities of those numbers is
boring we need to sex them up and let
people assume these numbers actually
means spending money we get to use also
make sure to never take into account
refunds bank fees sweat equity taxes
paying employees or any of those other
nagging costs we don't want our list of
idiots to realize those huge numbers we
use isn't actually profit if your
product sucks so bad that you don't even
have big numbers to show just make him
up these fools won't know the target
psychological emotion we're triggering
here is proof let's get on to scam
tactic number six don't give any actual
helpful information just talk about the
end benefits remember we're trying to
scam people in the least amount of time
so don't you dare do anything helpful
for these people don't do helpful things
at all don't give them real case studies
don't give them real examples don't give
them helpful how-to guides just make
sure you keep pumping them full of
dreams and only give them good
information if they pay for it the best
part is once we get their money it
doesn't matter how we tell them to make
money just send them some craptastic
ebook about working hard or some crap
like that these suckers will never know
over here we're exploiting the target
psychological emotion of buying a
product that will solve all problems
scam tactic number seven be ultra
aggressive when you say
because you won't ever see these people
again there are legit companies that do
this lame keeping a customer for life
kind of thing but we don't give a
about our people we want quick returns
and don't care if we burn bridges spam
them lie to them pander to their
emotional hot buttons make them feel
really stupid for not buying do anything
who cares if legal to get them to buy
we're trying to scam people into buying
a shitty product here so we have to make
them feel stupid for not doing it
you need to exploit their FOMO their
fear of missing out
we need to use language like how stupid
are you going to feel on Sunday when you
miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
to find the riches you deserve or are
you going to sit back and walking for
someone else or are you ready to be your
own boss and finally start calling all
the shots make sure that you're
extremely aggressive about this
like this really turned the pressure up
for vulnerable people to buy it combines
the two powerful psychological tactics
of time constraints and questioning
their intelligence which brings us to
our final scam tactic number 8 now that
you've got their money run I mean 50
percent of the people you make a sale to
will realize they've been scammed and
try to refund but 50 percent of these
suckers are too dumb and lazy to refund
so we will always make money because
we've scanned them these people will
unlikely ever buy from us again but who
cares right we're only in this for the
short term not building a healthy and
long term business or anything okay okay
this is actually Neville here not evil
Neville anymore the whole point of this
video is to kind of show a fun and
opposite way of how to sell we don't
actually want to scam people that's a
bad idea and usually scammers don't last
that long and generally either get
arrested or flame out in some major way
instead if you're going to put time and
effort into selling something if you
just put time and effort into making
sure the product is good the customer is
service the customer has helped buy it
then people will come back to you over
and over and over again we teach a lot
of this stuff here
copywriting course we actually make a
really great training course over here
that thousands of people and businesses
have used it's quick it's useful and
even picking up one new concept from it
can make back your entire investment
quickly it trains you and your
colleagues on writing website copy that
makes sales or signups writing
autoresponders that automatically send
marketing and make sales writing emails
that bring in sales and attention
writing great converting blog posts if
this sounds like something you'd like to
start learning take a few minutes to
check out the copywriting course we do
our best to make these articles and
videos and content super super fun and
entertaining for people to learn so hope
you join us on the inside and keep
scanning just just kidding actually keep
providing value and making the world a
better place not scamming this is nevla
Medora I'll talk to you later
you
it also shows the vehicle was repaired
and you offered to hire Viacom and in
who sir search it hold on me so your
information is that I had an accident a
road traffic accident okay
can you tell me where it was description
of the accident was the name of the know
I see well how do you know I've had an
accident and and what is my name
how do you know you're talking to the
right person what's on your screen
I have just asked you in your own words
to explain
OSE well I'm recording this conversation
that's good
you'll know that then I hadn't had an
accident that this is obviously some
scam and well I have AI haven't had the
accident B I've not reported it the car
has not been repaired or done anything
so I'm a little curious as to why you're
ringing me and bothering me with a
number which you've also rang earlier
today and yet when I try to return the
call
you are only the number that comes up
you're not able to ring back well you'll
be able to tell me what my registration
is run you okay so you are asking for
information from me but you won't give
me and that is asking for information
isn't it I don't know where you've got
your information from but I can tell
that that sort of means nothing because
you won't tell me what the insurance
companies right okay so why do you want
to know this information anyway okay
well again that doesn't really mean
anything does it it's feedback
I explained everything to you Richard
yes I appreciate that you know I
realized that I wasn't worried about
ringing doing that because I haven't had
no they've signed off so there we go
I've not had an accident and they're
just ringing up telling me that I have
had an accident
how curious is that just a few moments
ago certainly it's oh one two double
four yep
one one one yeah five six seven
brilliant and it did anything they say
they would play they were the MIB they
just said that they were a feedback
service ringing on behalf of the motor
insurance insurance Bureau well they
said the woman there said that I
understand you've had an accident and
we'd like to know that we're a feedback
service and in your own words can you
tell me what happened I had an accident
about fifteen years ago but certainly
not she said it was in the last six
months I have the recording of it yes of
course if you got an email I can send
you the mp3 yes I mean I you know she
wanted me to explain what had happened
and of course nothing had happened so I
tried to keep her going to see if I
could get anything from her at all
please to see whether you've had an
accident if you have they obviously
refer you to a firm of solicitors who
will pursue it for you on your behalf
until they get the cost that they get
any kickback order beside yeah that's
when as long as them obviously it's
goodbye didn't have any information you
know about yourself some people the
dealer called from their information is
knowing which is which I've ever worried
really but yeah if you can put on does
that be really helpful yeah no of course
I'll do that immediately wonderful thank
you very much no worries bye-bye bye-bye
so they go ladies and gentlemen if you
do get a phone call like the one I've
just had it is worth checking out to see
because clearly I hadn't had an accident
I knew I hadn't had an accident and
these people were fishing
fraudsters attempt to scam vulnerable
Americans every day the FBI has received
numerous reports about Internal Revenue
Service telephone scams if this weren't
such a serious problem the following
would be an amusing exchange the
following is a real recording of an
attempted scam where an Orange County
District Attorney investigator received
a scam on his personal cell phone
you
IRS is filing box
against you to get more information
about this case file please call
immediately on our department number
five zero nine seven nine and zero zero
three five four

long one okay I can just penetrate you
from the phone itself you have like a
really thick accent I'm guessing you're
either Vietnamese or Filipino I ain't no
Filipino I'm not via to me sounds more
Filipino accent to me tagalog maybe how
are you old enough to know old enough to
know you sound like a young lot to me
wow you're actually not very good at
what you do then no I'm pretty good than
what I do you're you're a young lot okay
because old guys they don't have time
for this [ __ ] well it actually ties
up your lines for a few minutes to where
you can't call it the possible victims
but actually you are calling the police
that's the part that's hilarious hell
not possible you're a liar - no my god
you're a liar so do you have a script
that they give you and then you
basically go down a decision matrix no
nothing like that nothing like that now
you guys get ripoff people from their
money it's easy to rip off people
American so stupid you don't know the
script - you know make a maker American

them vegetables absolutely usually the
good cons call them whales or pigeons

via one thing if there's nothing to
learn okay there's nothing to learn Eric

anything that works it does work we pick
up all people we cup non-american we
pick up immigrants yeah pick up some of

a waste of resources no no nice don't
like that iffy

thousand orders or one dollar this
little victim you're a busy man yes I am

police that is the hilarious part of
this so what you know what's hilarious
you call yourself police that's
hilarious
I know it isn't it this froster is
sitting in a foreign country using scam

employee one record the employees name
badge and caller ID if available to call
1-800 three six six four four eight four

hey guys welcome back to spun off from
the BTN HD and today out of all the days
I received a dell scam call yes it was
really strange to call actually was for
my IT manager and what kind of alerted
him is that they gave him the one hour
service tag the correct service tag for
one of our servers and they knew the
model and all that stuff north so my IT
manager came in the room he said hey can
you look this up to see if it's one of
our servers I looked at our database and
it was one of our service so I loved
them right away to see what's going on
everything looked ok no problems and so
my IT manager transferred the call and I
started speaking to the guy he wanted me
to go inside the server go to the start
run a command go inside the event view
or go to administrative events do you
see any warnings
how many warnings do you have I told him
how many he was like ok that's a problem
I still eat all of them and I told him
yeah I deleted all of them are you
really doing anything that he wanted me
to say what was one of the event ID so I
give him a vent ID I was ok that's one
of that's a problem I search the event
ID and is basically a removable
plug-and-play problem that you know I
inserted a flash drive and I you know I
removed it the wrong way so yeah that
was a big problem in his eyes so he was
saying oh you know your server is
sending out a bunch of warnings to our
server in the Dell site which is really
weird because servers are not connected
or should not be connected to any Dell
servers at all talking to any Dell
servers outside of your network so that
was another red flag names like ok we
need to get into services or MS config
go into the run command and running
Emmett's config so Irena MS config Dane
says go inside your services tab and
click on the status column so I click on
the status column and names that go all
the way at the bottom do you see
anything that's not
running yeah sure everything there's a
bunch of stuff that's not running by
default there's always a bunch of
services from Microsoft Corporation
that's not working that's that's a given
right and it was okay that's a problem I
need to log into your machine can you
please go into a browser and then go
into team here I was like whoa whoa wait
a minute
first of all you're not gonna get into
my server I need to talk to your IT
manager or someone higher than you to
identify that you are a legit dell rep
so it was okay okay okay wait for 10 10
seconds let me put him in or a sudden
the phone goes dead you go silent he
hangs up about 30 seconds later my IT
manager gets another call and it's the
same person stating that he is the
manager that such as such told him that
that we didn't want to give him access
to the server and that you know we need
to get in because our server is sending
out you know logs to their server and
their Dell server site and it's you know
creating a conflict now when you
purchase a Dell server first things
first what you normally do is wipe it
clean rebuild it from the ground up now
this server has been up and running for
four years straight with no problems now
not at all I don't know where we're
gonna receive a call from Dell stating
that they're receiving log files from
the server
heck no plus they want a Team Viewer
inside machine that's not gonna happen
so one of the things I want I want you
guys to know is if Microsoft Apple or
any major company like Dell gives you
guys a call stating that your machine is
providing weird errors hang up don't
even bother with them I just played
along to see what was going on to see if
these guys are in our system but they
weren't an entire system it was just for
us I'm gonna try to get you to the Event
Viewer and stay if or do you see any
errors and warnings by default you're
gonna see warnings and errors that's a
given all right so Microsoft will never
contact
you if there's a problem with Windows
operating system Microsoft is gonna push
out a global patch for everyone they're
not gonna just basically pick you
because you're special and troubleshoot
your stuff for you
Apple is the same way you know you got
to go to the Apple Genius Bar to get
that stuff work or you gotta take it to
a Apple shop to get it fixed
they're not gonna contact you Dell don't
do that you actually have to call idelle
rep so they can open up a case a case
number and track that stuff so guys
that's what happened to me today with
September 11th via Dell crane call which
was hilarious it made my day and again
guys please be careful do not trust
people when they call you stating that
your machine is having issues and they
want to promote him right off hang up
the phone and I say guys I catch you
guys on the next one peace out
I had a couple landlines at home and
like most of you I just got call after
caller caller telemarketers now I love
telephones I work on telephone systems
for a living so I didn't want to give
her my landlines right I want to protect
my telephone at home and one day just
out of desperation I just handed the
phone to my kid I said here son waste
this guy's time on the phone my son he
he hung up the phone immediately he said
dad he said a bad word and I thought
that was just an air conditioning guy
why was an air-conditioning guy swearing
at my 14 year old kid right so I I was
just I realized that these guys they
don't care and they get to do and say
whatever they want and I was just
disgusted I was so frustrated and it
feels like such an invasion of privacy
to just receive these calls over and
over right so I was done I was done with
telemarketing I was done with it now why
is telemarketing such a problem today
right because phones have been around
for 140 years so why now is this such a
problem well
economics really is the reason why right
it's now possible to have 30 people
sitting in a room anywhere in the world
calling into the United States all day
long okay that wasn't possible 20 years
ago now thanks to voice over IP and the
internet and all of that and it's
possible now to do that technology and
economics the other issue is caller ID
manipulation okay we all think of caller
ID manipulation is spoofing which is
true caller Ids can be manipulated by
the telephone system offering the call
needs to be able to set the caller ID
it's very necessary technology for the
call forwarding and call call find me
follow me features and your doctor when
he calls and tells you of an automated
doctor's appointment that machine is
calling on behalf of hundreds of other
doctors and so it needs to be able to
put the right caller ID on the call and
offer to you okay why isn't anybody
doing anything about this okay
so telemarketing why isn't anyone doing
anything well I'm sorry to say that you
probably would look to the phone
companies to do something about
telemarketing right but telephone
companies can't help you okay
asking the phone company not to deliver
telemarketing calls is like asking the
post office not to deliver junk mail
okay
the cleverly constructed on piece of
junk mail looks like regular mail to the
post office right think they haven't
they have to deliver it the only way
they would be able to tell if it's junk
mail or not would be to open the
envelope okay and the post office of
course isn't gonna open the envelope
well it's the same thing with phone
companies they don't want to open the
envelope that would be answering the
call for you before delivering it to you
right then
no telephone company wants to do that so
how about the government so the
government can enact laws like the
do-not-call list and the telephone
Consumer Protection Act and they can
take complaints like the Federal Trade
Commission takes complaints from
everyone for regarding telemarketing and
they do an effective job at that but
they also will occasionally make these
big high-profile busts like a few weeks
ago they busted up the fake IRS in India
calling into the USA right and so they
they can do these big giant operations
or it takes a lot of resources to do it
they can bust it up and there's a lot of
money involved in that one operation but
for every one of those are thousands of
other companies that are trying to sell
you credit card reduction or trying to
you know offering your free cruise or
things like that right so the government
just can't keep up with all of these
because these operations hide behind
fake caller IDs and they just can't be
found right they can't easily be found
anyway unless they're big big players
okay so the government can help you and
the telephone companies can't help you
so what's this gonna what's this gonna
look like in 10 or 20 years right when
the network is already crushed by
telemarketing what do we do what's gonna
happen how do we fix this telemarketing
thing what's it gonna take all right so
what it's going to take is a pirate okay
somebody thinking differently something
somebody from the outside sort of doing
so deploying some some new technology
and some new tools okay so getting back
to a telemarketer
swearing at my son um when I when I was
done with that call I said this is it I
got to do something about this and if
I'm gonna stop telemarketing at my house
I'm a telephone guy I work on phone
systems I should be able to fix this
okay so I created a little app that when
you call my house first a little
greeting answers and says hey if you're
real person punch a button and you'll
ring through to my house from after that
once you do it just one time your caller
ID is allowed every time so just punch a
button your ring through and I put that
in front and and then people could call
me they could punch buttering through
what I was surprised to find was that
stopped 100 percent of telemarketing all
telemarketing stopped at my house by
deploying that greeting but I was
looking in the logs and I and I noticed
that the telemarketers of course we're
still calling but they thought that that
greeting was an answering machine and so
they would just hang up and move on
right because telemarketers all use that
100% of all telemarketers use these
things called predictive dialers which
will dial tens hundreds thousands of
numbers per hour trying to find real
people and they find real people by you
know we say hello hello they said they
have predicted Alice's that's a real
person in custody or an agent if they
hear just a lot of noise like press one
and you'll ring through to my house they
think that's an answering machine and
they would just move on so I'm looking
in the logs I noticed that this
telemarketers would call several times a
day they might call four times in a row
they'll call in the evenings weekend's
weekdays mornings
whatever they would just call constantly
the same numbers would call at different
times a day and it reminded me that's
what this is okay it reminded me of the
the scene in Jurassic Park where a
Muldoon says that they're they're
attacking the defenses they're there
they're attacking defenses looking for
vulnerabilities right
so these telemarketers are they're
attacking my house at different times a
day looking for vulnerabilities right
they'll try spoofing my local area code
for the caller ID right they'll block
their caller ID they'll put up a fake
caller Ids in so trying to get me to
answer the phone they're trying to get
me to answer and and I said well that's
great my machine blocks their machine
but maybe
get that machine to trip just stumble a
little bit when it gets to my house
right before it moves on let's try to
get it to stumble a little bit okay and
I remember when I was a kid there was a
old cartoon about this plumber knocking
on the door and then a parrot inside hit
says who is it and the plumber says it's
the plumber I've come to fix the sink
okay this is 40 years ago right the
brain is a weird thing right this stayed
in my brain for 40 years and then
resurfaced when I got these
telemarketers knocking at my door and I
said well maybe I could build a parrot
that would do that kind of thing to a
telemarketer okay so I recorded just a
sound file just hollows and let's see
what happens okay hello hello hello hi
there we go so I said hello a couple
times their predictive dialer cut me to
an agent now I got an agent on the phone
and that's when it came to me what's the
most expensive part of a telemarketing
operation it's that human being that I
just got on the phone there's a lot of
open-source software and you don't need
a phone anymore just a headset in a
computer and that's your telemarketing
shop right but that human being is their
most expensive asset and my machine just
got that human being on the phone so
then I thought well Wow let's see if I
can keep that guy engaged let's see if I
can keep these telemarketers engage for
a little bit okay so then I said just
some so I you know I built a little
clever algorithm trying to turn to talk
to telemarketer right and I said
sometimes I said just in name things
right you know I was having trouble
concentrating because you found exactly
like somebody I want the heights go with
so sorry okay that part again so things
like that right so and of course I would
record these calls right cuz I'm tuning
this algorithm constantly and I have to
wait for telemarketers to call back
knowing telemarketers because I don't
want people I know to go into this thing
right so telemarketers would get into
this so it was a long development
process to be developing this thing but
I started posting a few of these calls
online and it turns out nobody likes
telemarketing right and so and the calls
were funny they're entertaining and
they're funny and so I then created some
new robots right in more of hello hello
hello
and now hello hello hello hello alright
so I got more robots and more voices and
now I'm providing a method for everyone
to use these robots for their own
telemarketers ok so now instead of
engaging with the telemarketer yourself
or yelling at them or hanging up the
phone or ignoring them
now these robots these Jolly Roger
telephone robots can now engage with the
telemarketers and here's some real
examples of what goes on here ok hello
yes hi yeah are you Richard yeah I I'll
be honest you're the first lady I've met
with the name of Richard if you're
trying to mess with me this is pretty
funny actually because most the time I
can tell when someone's messing with me
I'm pretty sure you're messing with me
sure something tells me you are yeah are
you busy you're talking on another phone
are you playing a game for God's sake
uh-huh are you enjoying this no what
were you saying I'm asking you to verify
your address for the last four of your
social not just say yeah every time I
ask sure yeah sir sir okay let me finish
the question before you say yes and yes
and yes and yes
okay what is your opinion of Hillary
Clinton right you say this conversation
has got no we're sorry Kim can you start
over who this why are you calling I'm
not gonna do that I have to get these
questions done can you please not talk
she does help me out and let me ask you
the question yeah okay what is your
opinion of Hillary Clinton right mm-hmm
yeah like this might be the weirdest
conversation I've ever had with angling
yeah I feel like this conversation has
gone nowhere
doubtful Pegasus are we actually being
serious going on here are you trying to
waste my time when I get paid to speak
on the phone I told you I have much time
to waste it but why are you in your line
you don't have any well you're a judge
oh you know what sir I'm actually gonna
keep the money and I'm gonna give it to
somebody else because I don't like when
people play around my agents on the
phone phone you don't qualify for this

gronia blumenthal got a call from a
number she didn't recognize last month
i just answered it like not thinking
anything of it and it was like
a robotic voice on the other end just
saying to me that they're going to
cancel my pps and social security number
and realize really quickly like oh this
is a scam she hung up but has been
getting regular calls like these ever
since
sometimes we get up to three times a day
and
it's just kind of a constant thing going
on now and it's getting very annoying
comrades say there's been a big increase
in spoof calls in the past few weeks
they disguise their calls as if they
were coming from
legitimate say irish mobile calls we
have seen surges of calls
coming from certain countries and so we
can be pretty sure that a
good proportion of that surge is
actually scam traffic
garthy have issued warnings in recent
weeks about people pretending to be from
the department of social protection
on guard the shia kona banks and other
institutions
but they say while scammers stories or
methods may change
their goals remain the same to access
people's sensitive information
and to get their hands on people's money
their advice is not to engage with the
caller don't return
the call and don't follow automated
instructions never disclose personal or
financial information
hang up and block the number if possible
if you have any doubt at all
the call is genuine hang up and ring the
ring the organization back
not the number that phoned you but go to
the website of the organization
and ring them directly tell them what's
happened and ask them to verify that the
call is genuine
the group that represents the
telecommunications industry say they
work
with garthy and other bodies to address
malicious scams
victims of scamming should report it to
their bank and local guard the station
helen delau rte news

hi welcome back to finally revealed in
this episode I want to talk about a new
scam that's being done by some people
claiming to be with the Social Security
Administration and they called me twice
in one day and they left voicemail after
one of them I called back so I got some
further information I thought it would
be helpful to share it with you first of
all the phone number that shows up is
five one zero eight six three nine eight
one six from alameda california that
will show up when they're calling in
like many of us we don't answer if we
don't know the number and so many
scammers try to match up with our phone
number or the first few digits it's just
ridiculous so we wait to see if a
voicemail is left here a voicemail is
left and as you can see by some of the
other videos that are coming out now i
was dealing with some social security
things so I was curious so I called them
back I'll tell you what the message was
first and then what happened when I
called back first of all it's a total
scam so don't even answer them and if
you listen to the recording I thought it
was kind of funny in the first place and
it was just coincidental so that's why I
called them back I didn't think it was
real but listen to this is exactly what
it said first of all when I listen to
the voicemail it wasn't a person leaving
the message it was one of those
computer-generated voices so if somebody
typed it in probably so they couldn't do
voice recognition and busts the person
who did it which that technology is
available if you've got that why don't
you you know try it and report back to
us if that works so here's what the
message said it was a little bit cut off
but they start out saying this is Social
Security Administration we're reaching
we're trying to reach you to let you
know your social security number is
going to be suspended by the law
enforcement agencies immediately so
before anything goes wrong give us a
call back as soon as possible at our
callback number which is five one zero
eight six three nine eight one
and then they repeat that number again
well number one your social security
number will never be suspended number
two
the Social Security Administration will
never call you unless you have some
matter pending with them most often
they're not going to call you anyway
they're going to communicate with you
online or have you come in for a meeting
number three the real phone number for
the Social Security Administration is
807 seven two one two one three and
number four
law enforcement agencies what are they
talking about there is no social
security law enforcement agencies and
number five yes before anything goes
wrong okay so those are your warning
signs that this is a complete scam
please tell elderly people because we've
now trained hopefully we've trained our
parents and grandparents that you don't
respond to people calling for
credit-card information date of birth
information and definitely not social
security number that can help with
massive identity theft because they can
have access to all kinds of things so
you should never be calling someone that
you don't know that you haven't already
corresponded with and you have a direct
line and give them any personal
information like this so I hope this was
helpful to leave any comments if you
have any similar stories or if this was
helpful give me a thumbs up share it
with anyone who may not believe you so I
can be the one to tell them subscribe to
see our other videos check out the big
brass 4 videos on business and please
come back and see me next time thanks
for watching
you
hi this is officer Brian Schneider from
the IRS department the reason to this
call is to inform you that the IRS has
issued an arrest warrant against you and
your physical address is under a federal
investigation so call me back to get the
detailed information about your case my
contact number is eight one eight four
three six six five seven two I repeat
it's eight one eight four three six six
five seven two it's very important we
hear from you today thank you
all new at 11 a warning after a
frightening scam call that one local
woman says
seemed all too real our haley bull shows
us
who kept that woman from parting with a
lot of money plus what you need to know
if you end up on the other side
of a similar scam candy garrett doesn't
usually answer calls from unknown
numbers but the one time she made an
exception
i want people to know that this scam
is so real she says she picked up
expecting to hear from a nurse after her
husband's surgery
instead she says she heard her
daughter's voice saying she'd been in an
accident
then a man's voice who says he was part
of a gang threatened violence and her
daughter's life
and demanded money he goes your daughter
was in an accident she was in the wrong
place at the wrong time
i have your daughter thinking only of
saving her daughter she says she
followed directions
who leaves her husband in a hospital
that's how real it was ending up at a
suncoast credit union
we came together as a team and our
system worked
once there garrett says team members
helped get her daughter on the phone and
stop her from handing over thousands of
dollars
she said mom what's going on
about fell to my knees on the rise so
we see this more often than we would
like to
but we just always ask the members
the fbi says they see virtual kidnapping
calls regularly a scam playing on
emotions
these are incredibly believable calls
these alleged hostage takers will go to
great lengths
to put stress on the individuals special
agent ashley haynes says don't be afraid
to call law enforcement if you get one
of these calls
she says look out for a number you don't
know someone trying to keep you on the
phone demanding money and demanding it
now
stay calm secondly the thing would to do
would be
give no information about yourself or
your family
or loved ones third try to get that
loved one on the phone this phone call
one garrett hopes others can learn from
when you love somebody that much

"there is a very clever new scam going around that 
you definitely need to know about or should i say  "
"it's an old scam that's becoming newly popular 
again i've seen it being called the delayed  "
"disconnect scam but basically it takes advantage 
of a lesser-known feature in some phone systems  "
"to trick you and the worst part about it is they 
can trick you doing this even if you do everything  "
"completely right so it won't even be your fault 
so you really need to know about it in order to  "
"defeat it so first here's how the scam goes 
and then i'll go over how it actually works  "
"so you get a phone call from someone claiming 
to be from your bank they tell you your card  "
"has been compromised your card has been hacked 
whatever the usual and they tell you you know what  "
"you need to contact the number on the back your 
card which is exactly what you're supposed to do  "
"so then you do that you hang up you call the 
number on the back your card correctly by the  "
"way you call the correct number so after dialing 
someone picks up and they say hi this is whatever  "
"bank but at this point you have already been 
tricked you are still talking to the scammer  "
"wait a minute how did that just happen so here's 
how the scam works the first key to understand is  "
"that this is only going to potentially happen on 
landlines you see a lot of landline phone systems  "
"do not actually disconnect the call right away 
after you hang up the phone depending how the  "
"phone company has your specific system set up 
if you as the receiving party hang up the call  "
"however the other caller does not hang up on the 
other end then it will stay connected for anywhere  "
"from a couple seconds to several minutes until 
the original caller disconnects or that timer is  "
"reached so in the meantime if they didn't hang 
up if you pick up the phone again you'll still  "
"be talking to that same person so what the scammer 
does is after they hear you hang up they'll start  "
"playing a fake dial tone so then when they hear 
you pick up again to call the number on the back  "
"of the card like you're supposed to then they'll 
just stop the dial tone and then pretend to pick  "
"up as the bank and obviously what's especially 
bad about this is you can do everything right  "
"and still be tricked if you just didn't know 
so let me go over a few ways you can easily  "
"defeat the scam and then afterwards we can talk 
a little bit more about this so-called feature  "
"and why it exists now the first way to avoid this 
scam first of all if you receive the call on your  "
"cell phone then hanging up right away immediately 
disconnects the call you don't have to worry about  "
"it if you receive the call on a landline what you 
can do is call using a totally different landline  "
"if you happen to have 2 or more likely use a cell 
phone to call the number on the back of the card  "
"not the landline you just received the call on 
if you don't have a cell phone you only have that  "
"landline and you don't know how long the timer 
is for your particular phone company in your area  "
"then you have no choice really but to wait 10 
or 15 minutes even to be sure that that call was  "
"disconnected one thing you could do is call your 
phone company to ask what this delay disconnect  "
"time is though you might have to go through a few 
people before they know what you're talking about  "
"or alternatively you could have a friend call you 
i don't know if this has to be done by the friend  "
"having a landline or cell phone but you can have 
them call you then you hang up and they stay on  "
"the line and basically time for you how long it 
takes until they start to hear a dial tone which  "
"means that that's the amount of time that anyone 
is going to have to wait for the disconnect and  "
"then you know also one thing you could do to test 
it after not waiting the full amount of time is to  "
"dial a number that you know already like maybe 
your friend's phone number and then obviously  "
"if the scammer picks up again or someone picks up 
saying hi this is your bank while you just called  "
"your friend's phone number then you know it's 
the scammer and then you know that it was a scam  "
"now you might be wondering why does this feature 
even exist it sounds like a nightmare in security  "
"well i found a couple reasons the first being the 
idea is you could hang up the phone and then pick  "
"it up in another room to continue a conversation 
without the other person having to call you again  "
"and this was probably before cordless phones 
were a thing another reason that does make  "
"sense actually is so that if there was a weak 
connection between the two lines and it was  "
"cutting out it wouldn't hang up every time there 
was a weak signal that occurred but still that  "
"would kind of not explain why it would go on for 
several minutes maybe like a few seconds tops in  "
"there but there are other big questions like why 
does the call remain connected with a delay only  "
"if the receiving party hangs up and why does it 
disconnect immediately when the original party  "
"hangs up why not the other way around and why 
are there different delayed times so let me get  "
"into explaining all that now it actually took me 
quite a bit of digging to find out more details  "
"about this so-called feature or quirk of a 
phone system whatever you want to call it  "
"beyond what just some of the basic news articles 
were talking about when they were referring to the  "
"scam and all the articles that i was reading about 
it referred to this feature as delayed disconnect  "
"but it turns out that that's not actually the 
name of this feature one extremely informational  "
"bit of info i found was from a scanned pdf of 
this obscure book that i found on google books  "
"and it was called the informatics handbook in one 
section it describes the term call clearing which  "
"basically is how the phone system disconnects 
the lines depending on conditions it says call  "
"clearing aka clear down or tear down the orderly 
disengagement of a call in a switch network later  "
"on here's the key though it says note that three 
different control approaches are used in telephone  "
"systems first the calling party clear approach 
where the call is only cleared when the calling  "
"A-party puts down the handset then there's the 
called party clear approach where the call is  "
"cleared when the B-Party puts down the handset 
and third the first party clear where the call  "
"is cleared when either puts the phone down it then 
elaborates the A-Party clear approach means that  "
"the receiver can put down the handset and move to 
another phone extension without losing the call  "
"however it leaves B-Party vulnerable to having 
a phone unable to receive calls if the A-party  "
"does not hang up correctly there are also 
implications in hacker scams involving entry  "
"into systems requiring callback procedures so even 
in 1996 when this book was written 25 years ago  "
"they already realized that this feature could be 
potentially used to scam people so if you have  "
"a landline this is definitely something you want 
to know which of the approaches your phone system  "
"from your phone company uses obviously it sounds 
like first party clear makes the most sense if  "
"either party hangs up then the phone call should 
end even called party clear would be better i mean  "
"if you think about it if you're the person who's 
receiving the calls you don't really have control  "
"over who's calling you and how many times they 
call you so you should definitely have control  "
"over whether or not you want to end those calls 
so then why do phone companies even have this  "
"calling party clear approach well apparently the 
logic is that the original caller is the one who's  "
"paying the bill and they're paying for the call so 
they should theoretically be able to control when  "
"the call ends but that still seems completely 
backwards to me if someone receiving the call  "
"doesn't want to talk then they should be able 
to end it and i think most people will probably  "
"agree with me i also did some more digging 
and found that the term used for the condition  "
"on the phone system where the called party hangs 
up the line remains connected is something named  "
"called subscriber held or CSH and it turns out 
this phone system behavior or feature is pretty  "
"ancient i even found it in this document about 
phone systems from 1944 so it has been around for  "
"a long time so assuming a landline has calling 
party clearing how long is the actual delay and  "
"like i mentioned before that's going to depend 
on your phone company and potentially even the  "
"system that your local area phone system uses and 
i already talked about the options where you can  "
"call your phone company hope that the person knows 
what you're talking about or maybe have a friend  "
"test it with you and time it themselves but again 
i'm not 100% sure if this behavior still happens  "
"if the original caller is calling from a cell 
phone or if it has to be both people on landline  "
"now i wanted to know what the actual name of this 
delay or timer was so that if you called your  "
"phone company you could specifically ask about it 
but i couldn't really seem to find any universal  "
"name for it now in the United Kingdom at least i 
was able to find a document from the NICC which  "
"talks about UK interoperability standards and they 
refer to it as the CSH timeout called subscriber  "
"health we mentioned that before and it actually 
does have a specification called timer TO-01  "
"and it looks like the NICC set a possible range 
that phone companies could choose for this timer  "
"and it could be anywhere from two seconds to three 
minutes and again this is only in the UK in the  "
"united states i've seen cases where it could be 
longer so it's not going to apply everywhere also  "
"in this document i found another timer called 
TO-03 which is apparently a backup timer in case  "
"the signal for the 01 timer failed to get sent 
or something and again everything in here seems  "
"to only apply to the UK so this TO-01 timer might 
not be used anywhere else except in the UK however  "
"there was one statement by a Canadian telecom 
company called Shaw where in their statement they  "
"referred to it as the call clearing delay time 
and this is actually the same term used by British  "
"Telecommunications in their press release when 
they reduced that time so it seems like this could  "
"be a pretty good term to use hopefully that now 
this scam is getting a lot more press attention  "
"companies will kind of follow suit from the UK 
and reduce this greatly if they still have it  "
"implemented there was actually one pretty major 
news story done in Canada and the news agency CTV  "
"contacted several different companies in Canada 
to ask what their delay time was and they got  "
"some responses so Shaw company did say that they 
will shorten the timer to combat the fraud though  "
"they didn't give a specific number two other 
companies they contacted Telus and Rogers said  "
"that there is disconnect after 10 seconds and one 
company Bell didn't say it all now i was actually  "
"curious what the deal was in the united states so 
i tried contacting AT&T and Verizon via support  "
"chat those are two really big companies in the us 
and actually got responses so here was my question  "
"it was high i'm trying to find out the call 
clearing delay time for landlines meaning how long  "
"a phone call stays connected after the receiving 
party hangs up Verizon said thank you for reaching  "
"out to us this varies from call to call actually 
many things go into how long a line remains  "
"engaged after the call is completed and terminated 
by the handset cellular lines will disconnect and  "
"terminate faster than a traditional copper line 
would but generally the line is terminated within  "
"1-2 seconds AT&T's response was this the call will 
get disconnected right away after the receiving  "
"party hangs up so assuming the representative 
knew exactly what i was talking about  "
"it sounds like these companies use either first 
party clearing or a very very short disconnect  "
"time but it maybe would still be worth it to 
test out yourself just to be sure in any case  "
"though now that you at least know about this scam 
you can be prepared for it if it ever happens to  "
"you so let me know what you guys think down in the 
comments if you still have a landline did you know  "
"that this was a thing that could happen with 
your phone line also if you enjoyed the video  "
"be sure to give it a thumbs up and also subscribe 
because i try to make a couple videos a week so  "
"it should be worth it if you guys want to keep 
watching the next video i recommend is where i  "
"was talking about new scams in 2021 so definitely 
check that out it should be worth a watch you can  "
"just click on it right there so thanks so much 
for watching guys and i'll see in the next video"
actually getting a phone call that
claims you're facing criminal charges
it's a scary thought that actually
happened to one Valley man deciding to
contact 13 consumer alert what you need
to know the next time your telephone
rings I think I was sleeping it was
early one morning last month when
Christopher Schneider says he got a
phone call from an unknown number he was
shocked when he heard the voicemail
message that just says that I'm being I
have a lawsuit pending against me the
caller said he was with the California
Attorney General's Office
Christopher was directed to call them
back right away or he could be arrested
I freaked out a month I'm thinking okay
is there some kind of pending litigation
of a you know past bill Christopher
admits his credit isn't great but says
he was working with his creditors so he
caught the number back right away scared
he could be facing jail time and it
rings once and comes up the magicJack
customer you're trying to reach is
unavailable
that's when Christopher knew it was all
a scam no legitimate government office
is going to call you using an Internet
phone service like magicJack it blows my
mind that this even happened but I'm
just glad I didn't go any further than
what it did attacked 13 bottom line
scammers often claim to be with
well-known companies and agencies but
remember if you're facing litigation
someone will serve you with paperwork or
send it by certified mail if you get a
similar call don't be afraid to ask
questions and don't give away any
personal information or pay anything
over the telephone we have more
important information about phone scams
on our website at ktnv com just click on
links under the on-air tab
welcome back we have a help me Hank
consumer alert about a new and pretty
scary phone scam
yeah imposters calling with a fake story
about your social security number being
compromised so far Americans have lost
millions
here's helping Hank with what you need
to watch for these scammers are after
one thing your social security number
once they have that number they're
working to steal your identity and it
could cost you big time it's a scam
growing at a frightening rate people
pretending to be from the Social
Security Administration crying to get
your social security number and your
money
the FTC issued a brand new warning and
take a look at the numbers in 2017 3200
people reported this imposter scam
those people lost about two hundred and
ten thousand dollars total last year
thirty five thousand people reported the
scam to the FTC the money lost ten
million here's what one of those scam
call sounds four digits of your social
security number when you call to better
assist you with this issue now if I
don't hear a call from you we will have
to issue an arrest warrant under your
name and get you arrested
so scammers say your social security
number has been suspended due to
suspicious activity sometimes the
scammer wants to confirm the number to
reactivate it the scammer may even try
to tell you that your bank account is
about to be seized and may try to
confirm that number as well here's the
really tricky part the caller ID often
shows the real number of the Social
Security Administration 1-800 one two
one three the scammers are faking the
number so what should you do first your
social security number is not about to
be suspended the administration never
calls to threaten you your benefits or
to tell you that you have to wire them
money anyone who tells you that is a
scammer if you're worried or suspicious
hang up and call the Social Security
Administration yourself and
never give out your social security
number or your bank information or even
your credit card information to anyone
who contacts you out of the blue
now that scam is not only taking place
across the country but we're hearing
about it here in Metro Detroit that's
why we wanted you to be aware it's
important to share this information with
your family and friends so they know
when that call comes that it is in fact
a scammer
I'm Hank Winchester help me Hank there's
so many clever ways out there that they
try to get you that you really have to
have that defense mechanism up all the
time like don't just trust it first do a
little research before you give out any
information right and if you are a
boomer and you're watching us right now
and you have concerns about your aging
elderly parent make sure especially if
they live alone make sure that they are
taken care of and they know a minor
percent because they're usually the
major targets for these types of scams
this is your marketplace
exclusive access catching the scammers
in our backyard it certainly helped CBC
did their expose or episode on
marketplace first the CRA scan I fed
them the inside story from India we were
trained like that who pretend to be
legen our iris officer then tracking the
tech support scam why do you do this
illegally what does it say that we were
able to get inside calls for action make
sure that Canadians are protected
organized criminals and the scams won't
stop their money laundering
CRA scam tech support scams sin skin all
connected feeding on each other's leads
revealed only on your marketplace
[Music]
just outside Toronto federal agents are
gearing up the rest go after months of
investigation they're about to carry out
key arrests way comes Oh we'll be
cracking down on an international scale
targeting Canadians safety we have
exclusive access to witness this
takedown rates 2 a.m. we've just got the
call we've been waiting months to
receive we knew the Mounties have been
watching alleged scammers and how they
tell us they're ready to move in in some
ways this began two years ago with an
investigation of our own on the other
side of the world it's a scam Canadians
know all too well not the real Canada
Revenue Agency but one of the largest
cyber schemes in Canadian history
there will be legal as we work to locate
the scam centers in Mumbai India we met
up with a whistleblower who previously
worked inside one
Jayesh Dube it was big money yeah it was
big money more than you would make
anywhere else I can only get anywhere no
easy to read the script threatened the
person on the other end of the line all
while impersonating an American tax
agent thank you for calling IRS home LP
so we were trained like that to become
an IRS officer to pretend to be like an
hourish officer you're threatening
people you're saying they could go to
jail they could get arrested do you
could get arrested if you cry to fight
against the IRS then the penalty is
"$75,000 which you can never pay and your"
assets and all is going to get please we
track calls like that to a scam center
inside this building
[Music]
but when our local helpers knock on the
door so the the call center has moved
out they some of they realized someone
was on to them it turns out the danger
is still there
so it's now clear to us this area is
dangerous that we need to get out that
we're being watched and other people who
went into the building for us they're
being followed it all shows how
dangerous these scammers can be why do
you think they were following him we
still have questions how do the scammers
know who to call
how do they get money from victims could
it be there's an accomplice at the top
in Canada
Jahangir rashidi has those same
questions how did this start with one
call phone call they call and they said
this is Revenue Canada and Government of
Canada lawsuit view for ninety nine
thousand five hundred dollar what did
you think when you heard it's a huge
amount I said I don't have it he said go
and borrow from the bank go to your
friend go to your employee go wherever
you can make money doesn't matter just
you have to pay you have to pay you pay
he's from Iran where the government
actually does make demands like this he
worried the call was legit and paid big
one hundred and ten thousand altogether
forty five thousand was my RSP and then
five thousand dollar my saving account
"$4,000 for my last paycheck checking"
"account $5,000 from my son"
and the rest credit card long line of
credit is life savings gone back in
India so how long have you been police
commissioner here top cop Paramveer
Singh says the scam kingpins are leading
a rich light one of the main accused he
had a very high-profile lifestyle he was
probably thinking about buying a private
jet also at that point of time a private
jet he was thinking of buying one yes
funded by million stolen from victims
living in North America and Commissioner
Singh has another shocker about police
in Canada nobody contacted us from
Canada
no one's caught no one no one contacted
American authorities did contact us no
one contacted although on the website of
RCMP and we did see a post relating to
other cases once but you're telling me
"60,000 people at least have complained"
in Canada and nobody from Canada is
doing anything nobody pointed and the
only way you found out about it is by
going on the RCMP website yourself
that's right yeah
that doesn't seem right they don't
simply
when our story airs across Canada there
is outrage
can the Public Safety Minister explain
why Canadians have to depend on the CBC
to unearth this scam and protect
Canadians will the Prime Minister tell
us how we will follow up to ensure that
these calls stop and to make sure that
Canadians are protected against
organised criminals in India services
and intelligence agents to do what needs
to be done to protect Canadians at home
and overseas the RCMP later say they
have been talking to India but all this
attention puts the issue on the front
burner empowering more people to come
forward this is really scary this is
really scary my stomach was just at SEC
you feel thick a month after our story
taught brass order a special task force
be set up at this secure facility
outside Toronto we get inside the
headquarters but what the RCMP call
project Octavia it's essentially a
national priority investigation and
inspector Jim Ogden has a surprise
certainly what I know and what I can
share is that there are our known
targets leads when we get enough
evidence then we will charge and
prosecute these individuals and just so
I'm clear are we talking about people
who are in this country in Canada that's
correct
who are helping carry out this scam
that's correct they're defrauding the
Canadian public and sending it sending
it away they're their money laundry
while the Mounties focus on tracking the
Canadians connected to this crime
our trail took us back to India a year
after our first investigation into the
CRA scam and we closed in on the call
centers carrying out another one this
time we had something up our sleeve
hiring someone to sneak in a hidden
camera were the first to get inside the
tech support scam with criminals using
scare tactics to demand payment for a
computer fix you likely don't need what
made you think this was legitimate he
sounded genuinely concerned and led me
to believe that he could fix the problem
when Diane begins Facebook account stops
working she calls up a number she thinks
is for Facebook support but ends up with
a convincing scammer instead when you
look back on it now how do you feel
about it I was vulnerable at the time
and I was impulsive yeah and I feel very
violated that they had access to
everything on our computer our laws
should protect us against things like
this
after months of our own investigation
we're ready to confront those targeting
Canadians which is amazing to think it's
right here
back in India we've seen the scammers
can be dangerous so we're moving quickly
[Music]
the company whose name is at this
address says this is a legitimate
operation but we know some of the people
inside are running a scam why do you
have a call center here
why do you do this illegally we want to
talk to top bosses there are real
victims real victims these are real
people who cannot afford to lose this
money you're taking it from them it
seems no one here wants to talk to us at
least while we're here they're off the
phones anyone want to say anything
nobody okay
back in Canada we share our findings
with the RCMP s highest-ranking
Financial Crimes official superintendent
Peter Payne what does it say that we
were able to get inside a call center
like this yeah no I applaud your efforts
for getting in there but once again
police alone cannot solve this issue
there's lots of call centers over what
do you say to the scammers were over
there if you think they're unstoppable
uh we're not giving up this battle turns
out that's a bit of foreshadowing the
Mounties know there are accomplices in
Canada they know who they are we're
about to find out too
this is your market place on the roads
outside Toronto a man has no idea police
are on his tail the RCMP closing in on
Canadians they say are accomplices in an
enormous cyber scheme and we're about to
witness it all go down we're just
outside the RCMP secure facility after
months of investigation into some of the
largest cyber schemes in Canadian
history they're ready to take action and
these are schemes like the CRA scam the
tech support scam the bank investigators
scanned the syn card scam
all of it coming to a head early this
morning we started our investigation in
October of 2018 inspector Jim Ogden
oversees project Octavia the specialists
unit investigating oversees call center
scams my message is that we'll find you
and we'll we'll further investigate and
we'll we'll charge where we can
we've traced many of these scams back to
India like the tech support scam how
much money was stolen from you three
thousand three thousand dollars when now
hid fill opposes phone stops working she
Google's a solution and calls the number
that appears on her screen he went onto
the phone and he said there are many
problems on the phone there are hackers
from Russia from India from Brazil he
said all that about your phone yeah he
said it's a complicated issue we need to
work on this phone has to be minimum
three thousand dollars to be able to do
the transaction now he pays on her money
gone I said where's my money is where
does one money are you with this
converse are you thieves he's then hung
up the phone then I tied the game like
ten times twelve times nobody want to
answer even as police close in on
multiple scams the scammers are adapting
adding a new scheme involving Canadian
Social Insurance numbers we just
offended your social insurance number
and legal enforcement action will be
taken against you as we found some
suspicious activities and law
enforcement is getting help from a big
name in the tech world that's bringing
us back to Microsoft headquarters near
Seattle and the inside its Digital
Crimes Unit we were here a year ago
checking out how artificial intelligence
is helping trace the scammers this is a
very profitable crime with a very low
risk of prosecution we need to invert
that equation lawyer one hard way
overseas the global unit here feeding
tips and evidence to India over the last
ten months
Indian law enforcement has dismantled
ferry call centers has brought to
justice
seventy two directors of call centers
there but Microsoft tells us while there
have been arrests in India there hasn't
been one conviction of a scam boss since
2014 you got this letter right
show me that that's really interesting
but Hardaway says they're not giving up
continuing their war with the scammers
he says Microsoft gets a complaint of
someone impersonating their agents every
seven minutes but guys are now selling
calls for call centers to exploit it's
almost like a scam franchise exactly and
it has evolved into that because there's
so much money to be made and as I said
the profits are so big relative to the
investment our own investigation has led
us to believe that there are people in
Canada
helping with this scam helping move
money and do other things is that
something that you understand as well
yeah that's correct
one trail leads to this house in
suburban Vancouver CBC the first to
discover court documents which accused
the man who lives here of retrieving the
money for a fraud connected to these
scams
he even allegedly moves approximately a
million dollars through his accounts
prosecutors say that is laundering the
proceeds of unlawful activity and are
trying to seize the house his father
owns it and denies any wrongdoing while
his son has now reportedly fled to China
we need to target the wallets of the bad
guys so that if the money stops flowing
they're not going to be able to keep
their operation running and they will go
out of business
Microsoft is targeting those money mules
and talking the Canadian police about
how to do it we're working with law
enforcement and with also other banks
financial services industries to
identify those bad bank accounts or
merchant accounts so that they can be
suspended and money be returned to
victims and they're not the only ones
Canadian police are hot on the case too
the Mounties are about to take down what
they call a super money mule a top-level
scam associate who lives right here in
Canada
who they are and how the Mounties found
them coming up
this is your marketplace it's a federal
raid our CMP officers about to move in
there on the tail of a man they say is a
big player in scam calls that plague
Canadians they took away my trust my
confidence everything now hid philipose
is a victim of one of those scams she's
waited a long time to see action who
should be trying to stop these guys
why done that what it is in Canada and
India cooperate together victims like
knobhead and all of us who get these
calls incessantly are about to see the
RCMP act
seconds after the target arrives at work
officers move in
we're not allowed to get any closer to
this Factory in Georgetown Northwest of
Toronto
as the man and the reflective jacket is
taken into custody everything in his
pockets placed in bags by police seems
he had no idea that he was being
surveilled that people police officers
were following him and they got him just
as he showed up for work we've agreed
not to identify the police since many of
them are undercover
the man is being charged with fraud
money laundering and property obtained
by crime we watch as he's taken away a
morning he'll probably never forget as
the man arrives at the RCMP headquarters
in Milton Ontario to be fingerprinted
and processed officers are on the phone
to his wife telling her she's wanted -
her husband already in custody she's
told to turn herself in
and were there when she arrives
[Music]
they were essentially money mules or
money mule managers that were receiving
bags of cash
RCMP inspector Jim Ogden tells us his
team's investigation shows this couple
was working directly with Indian
scammers and then essentially dispersing
it and making it accessible to those
that are running the illegal call
centers in India what helped get you to
this point today
the CBC Marketplace episode you did in
India certainly raised a flag for the
public safety minister and a senior
representatives in the RCMP at a later
news conference Gurinder Preet dhaliwal
37 years of age from Brampton Ontario
and inderpreet Delhi well 36 years of
age also from Branton are charged with
the following criminal offenses
one count of fraud over $5000 one count
of laundering the proceeds of crime and
one count of property obtained by crime
the Mounties reveal thousands of dollars
in cash more than a hundred thousand in
jewelry even a money counting machine
allegedly used by the couple the couple
have yet to appear in court to submit a
plea in response to the charges it's
about time a lot time guys we show
footage of the arrests tonight when you
see a guy like that in handcuffs I'm
happy definitely very happy about that
and I appreciate what the police has
done to do this this is a big victory
even if I'm not getting my money I'm
happy that an action is being taken for
other people to be saved this is very
important
kudos to the woman who knew interviewed
and was willing to come forward and tell
everything tell all victims need to see
that that they're not alone watching the
RCMP take down mark simcha s'en the
former head of a major fraud unit good
for them good for them well bloody time
this is something that you've waited a
long time to see are you surprised that
it's happened I wanted to have faith and
I'm glad they proved me right that's
kudos to them because that must have
been really difficult must have been
really difficult and kudos to
marketplace and hookahs because here are
the ones that instigated all of this in
my view what do you know the likelihood
is that these scam calls disappear not
very not very they're gonna continue the
frequency may drop may change why is
that because there's still victims here
that are vulnerable fraud is you know
it's theft with a smile the arrests
aren't over the RCMP say they're
targeting more people in Canada
and abroad this is gonna be a deterrent
for sure we're gonna get our
co-conspirators that are here in this
province thinking twice about well I
thought we were untouchable and they're
not
it's the counterfeit crackdown it says
in big red letters we don't sell any
fakes five companies 100 products I'm
shocked by me other people are just
happening too how many other people
don't even know this is happening
getting a good deal or getting ripped
off with us safe
and you follow the money it gets really
scary could the products be dangerous

do you ever do you have any cheaper ones
than that because that's quite expensive

so you want to cancel it then i'm going
to refund your money 399 pounds
uh
right i don't think i've got 399 pounds
yes
um
he's sure it's me because i i don't have
that kind of money in my account so i um
i wonder if it's another member of my
family
who's the order for
if you want to cancel it then i'm going
to refine your 399 because the purchase
has been made your site
so that's why getting this call
right
well i know in my account i don't have
that kind of money so
um it must be another family member i
think
this account so that's why getting this
call
right i wonder if my son ordered it
because he's into all the technology and
stuff i i can't say i really understand
it
you want to cancel it and i'm going to
guide you how can cancel this order from
your site okay uh well if my son placed
it do you know who placed the order
sir it might be possible some unknown
person trying to misuse your details and
create the fake animals in the counter
i'll order iphone 7.
ah see
so that's why
so you think that somebody's ordered the
phone but but not really
because your numbers update this account
so that's why getting this call right so
you cannot cancel this order from
your side then i'm going to take another
399 pounds and i'm not going to
slip on your money 399 pounds so so as
the money already left my account then

about is i think i've got about like 15
pounds in my account so i don't i don't

don't have 399 pounds
so i wonder if it's another family
member you need to speak to

uh for family member sorry
um
does it say who ordered it because i've
got two two of my sons it could be one
of them maybe
does he have a name or is it just my
name
i have more details
and more information because the
purchase has been made
so that's why getting this call because
today's last verification call and your
numbers update this account so that's
for getting this call sir all right so
it's under my name i don't remember
ordering a phone
yeah no that makes sense do you know
what i'll be honest with you i was
pretty drunk last night so i wonder if i
ordered a phone by accident
i was looking for a new phone and uh
maybe drunk ordered one
when was he ordered
iphone 7
what what time did the order come in it
wasn't after 11 o'clock was it because
if it was i think i know what happened
could you could you tell what time the
order came in
you want to place this order just let me
know
if i want to place the order
okay i'm going to place this order from
my side
oh no no no i'm saying is that what
you're asking i don't i don't i i don't
i mean i do need a new phone but i i i i
i can't remember ordering one
but if i'm honest i had a bit too much
to drink last night so i maybe did order
one by mistake which i'm if i did i'm
really sorry about
yeah well there isn't the money in there
so there's only i think like say 15 16
pound in my account as i say i had a bit
of a rough night last night
do i still have to buy it even if i
ordered it when i was drunk
do what do i still have to buy it even
though will he do i'll see do i get bad
customer reviews if i cancel stuff or is
that all right
with me i'm going to refund your money
399
okay
you're going to reform the money for me
okay
i'm going to cancel this order from your
side and i'm going to refer you on money
399 pounds okay
so tell me do you have a mobile phone uh
no no i i i don't have one unless you're
sending me that one
could you say again
connection please tell me now an
internet connection i do have an
internet connection yeah
okay which mobile do you use internet

i i that's probably why i think i was
looking last night i've maybe had a bit
too much to drink and then
been looking at phones because i need
one my son keeps telling me i need one
bit old you see i'm not really into all
that technology stuff i don't understand
it

from my side and i'm going to refine
your my 399 pound

documentation
the investigation start when we found an
abandoned car on the south border of
texas
and the car contained some blood and
drug residues inside it
after investigation we found that the
car was rented on your name
on your personal social information and
there are two
addresses linked with your car linked
with that title of the car
we found some kind of documentation from
financial institutes such as the
bank of america u.s bank wells fargo td
bank
and many other credit unions as well we
have also collected 22 pounds of
cocaine okay so first of all can you
tell me

social security and money laundering and
drug trafficking
okay now and this
and the entire paperwork has your name
on it and thousands of dollars has been
wired and transferred from these bank
accounts locally and internationally
which totally sends suspicious to the
earth and that is the only reason
why federal my social security
department
has filed a case against you for a drug
trafficking as well as money laundering
now let you know have you any questions
regarding this case
yeah i think this this is a mistake i
think
you're not like i don't know okay it's

greatings sewers air at the car guy also
known as eat ECG one man posting videos
to this channel hey thanks for watching
and you know what if it is your birthday
I want to wish you a very special happy
birthday yes that's a very special happy
birthday to you
bye let's have some fun today I got this
in the mail not too long ago and what
this is is one of these things where
they they want to contact you and tell
you your vehicle's out of warranty it
says Eric this is our attempt to inform
you that the factory warranty on your
2007 Mini may have expired or is about
to expire please call within 5 business
days call to confirm receipt of this
notification as soon as possible if you
go without coverage you will be
responsible for all repairs in the event
of a breakdown
now I'm past this by two days the
deadline was actually seven eighteen as
you may have already seen here but I
thought you know what what the heck why
don't I call one of these people up they
don't know who I am and since they
recall they record my cup phone
conversations I'm going to record theirs
put this on speaker hello and thank you
for calling our loyalty vehicle
protection center for quality control
purposes your call may be monitored or
recorded please stay on the line and one
of our representatives will be with you
shortly
[Applause]
[Music]
good morning Jo my name is Eric cook and
I received a notice and the event and
the mail that the warranty was about to
expire on the vehicle that I just
purchased see oh yeah I see it it's up0
six five one seven six one one well to
be honest it's it's had a lot of issues
I think they're about a hundred and
fifteen on it now but I did buy it used
[Music]
that's why I was confused by there there
were a lot of problems there were some
oil leaks there were some noises from
the engine there were some problems with
the brakes there was some kind of water
leak inside of it and that's why I was
confused by your notice because to me it
seemed like the car really you know it
was an older car and I purchased it as
an older car and that kind of thing so I
wasn't too worried about any kind of
warranty stuff
okay well we do cover vf+ up to 20 years
"old up to 250,000 miles I mean with the"
at the mileage here as you would still
qualify for enhance level coverage which
is a great level of coverage that would
cover engine and transmission the drive
axle seals and gasket and still cover
the turbo that's on there it'll also
take care like your heating air
conditioning the cooling system your
fuel an electrical system as well so
what you're saying is if I had problems
with those systems you'd be covering
those repairs so really this isn't going
to help me for the problems I'm having
with the car now well like you said
you're not gonna you're not gonna you're
not gonna cover anything that's already
existing with the vehicle well as I said
it's got oil leaks it's got all the
clutches acting a little weird the
brakes have problems there was a water
leak inside of it so how much would this
coverage cost me
so that that would be almost as much as
the car actually that's more than what I
paid for the car so why why even bother
covering a vehicle where the repairs
cost more than the vehicles just I was
just curious because like I said I got
this notice and I wondered how I got it
because I only told a few friends that I
had got in a new car but you know it
just seemed a little odd to me that I
was getting a notice about a warranty
for a vehicle that was out of warranty
and obviously needed a lot had some
mechanical issues
okay well thank you for your time all
right you have a good day
well they didn't try to send me
something tell me something I didn't
need and they obviously wanted to avoid
doing or saying anything illegal so it
is aboveboard it's a business that
apparently well I don't want to say
preys upon people that might be ignorant
but that's kind of the reason why I
wanted to make this phone call because I
know that people get these notices for
these things all the time and may be
ignorant of the fact of you know what
exactly is happening so you know
apparently these people well to me it
appeared that these people are above
board now I can't speak for what happens
when you actually make a claim about a
repair but as you heard if you're going
to make a claim about a repair it can't
be about something that's already
existing on the vehicle because that
would be fraudulent
but as you heard the coverage for my
vehicle for five years would be 49
hundred dollars on a good day that car
all fixed up the way it is now I would
say is probably worth five fifty five
hundred as far as the the cost of the
vehicle so it would cost almost as much
and given the repairs that I've put into
the Mini at least of this vintage it's
to me it seems like diminishing returns
so there you have it I call the warranty
company up to find out what they have to
say about my Mini Cooper that they
wanted to sell me an extended warranty
on there it is anyway if you have
automotive questions not covered in this
video eric the car guy comm link down in
the description i will also link other
information and videos down in the
description to keep you entertained so
please check the description for
additional information aside from that
be safe have fun stay dirty I'll see you
next time thanks so much for watching
[Music]
your time is valuable i shall be brief
i'm going against the clock
60 seconds of your time to tell you
about a common type of scam
[Music]
you receive a phone call with a spoken
message that sounds something like
your tax return is compromised if unless
you press one you will be immediately
arrested
there are many variations of the details
sometimes it's an actual live caller not
a recording
sometimes it's a web pop-up it might
claim that you're being charged by
amazon or that your vehicle was involved
in a crime or just about anything else
that might worry or concern you if it
were true
if you follow through you'll be talking
to someone in a call center who will try
to gain access to your computer and try
to trick you into thinking there has
been a payment error that you need to
correct by sending them money or gift
cards
if you allow them to connect your
computer they may also install software
on it allowing them to continue
accessing later or they may lock you out
of your own system
you should hang up and prepare yourself
to hang up again in future if they call
back
if someone on the phone ever demands
payment with a backstory that seems
terribly urgent it's best to begin with
the assumption that it's a scam
if you're worried or in doubt you can
make a call to your own bank or to the
police or
amazon or whatever and they'll most
likely confirm that there's no genuine
emergency
keep calm don't allow someone else's
declaration of urgency to cause you to
dispense with proper caution and safety
time's up
of course that's only a nutshell outline
of this variety of scam
and that's the purpose of this video to
serve as a jumping off point for
discussion about it
to find out more check the links and
information in the video description or
let's discuss in the comments if there
are any very frequent questions i'll put
them in a pin comment so check for that
too
thanks for watching stay safe and i hope
to see you again soon

batch number
oh okay okay and your case number is
five two six eight nine three four five
slash
zero zero three okay so this is the
no henna am i getting some notification
about my social security
that's the reason because someone having
access to your social
someone using your social in money
laundering and drug trafficking
that's why we call you my social
security now
during yeah i have never shared my
social security number with anyone
maybe you're from your doctor's office
maybe
from your family members did you
lost your wallet no never all right okay
and
did you share your information did you
carry on
uh social to the your
insurance to your doctor's office no

don't know what's important
oh my god i'm just getting a little bit
you know
scared and confused like tell me you're
telling me from
which department from oh my god okay
don't be don't be getting confused okay
now the reason you are convicted that as
i told you someone having
access to your social uh one more thing
this is record is conversation okay so
we need to use this recording inside the
courthouse
so okay and what happened as per the
documentation
the investigation start when we found an
abandoned car on the south border of
texas
and the car contained some blood and
drug residues inside it
after investigation we found that the
car was rented on your name
on your personal social information and
there are two
addresses linked with your car linked
with that title of the car
we found some kind of documentation from
financial institutes such as the
bank of america u.s bank wells fargo td
bank
and many other credit unions as well we
have also collected 22 pounds of
cocaine okay so first of all can you
tell me
are you the one who handled 20 bank
accounts or how many bank accounts do
you have
only one
okay which bank you're banking with
[Music]
okay now so and as i see that the person
who using your information they have
access to your name their access to your
social security and money laundering and
drug trafficking
okay now and this
and the entire paperwork has your name
on it and thousands of dollars has been
wired and transferred from these bank
accounts locally and internationally
which totally sends suspicious to the
earth and that is the only reason
why federal my social security
department
has filed a case against you for a drug
trafficking as well as money laundering
now let you know have you any questions
regarding this case
yeah i think this this is a mistake i
think
you're not like i don't know okay it's
not
mistake okay and that is not mistake
someone having
access to your social okay so what i'm
going to do
i'm going to follow all the details
inside the code house do you have any
audio do you have any criminal lawyer
[Music]
okay so now do you want me to help you

from this money laundering and drug
trafficking case

taxes okay it's a social security office

greatings sewers air at the car guy also
known as eat ECG one man posting videos
to this channel hey thanks for watching
and you know what if it is your birthday
I want to wish you a very special happy
birthday yes that's a very special happy
birthday to you
bye let's have some fun today I got this
in the mail not too long ago and what
this is is one of these things where
they they want to contact you and tell
you your vehicle's out of warranty it
says Eric this is our attempt to inform
you that the factory warranty on your
2007 Mini may have expired or is about
to expire please call within 5 business
days call to confirm receipt of this
notification as soon as possible if you
go without coverage you will be
responsible for all repairs in the event
of a breakdown
now I'm past this by two days the
deadline was actually seven eighteen as
you may have already seen here but I
thought you know what what the heck why
don't I call one of these people up they
don't know who I am and since they
recall they record my cup phone
conversations I'm going to record theirs
put this on speaker hello and thank you
for calling our loyalty vehicle
protection center for quality control
purposes your call may be monitored or
recorded please stay on the line and one
of our representatives will be with you
shortly
[Applause]
[Music]
good morning Jo my name is Eric cook and
I received a notice and the event and
the mail that the warranty was about to
expire on the vehicle that I just
purchased see oh yeah I see it it's up0
six five one seven six one one well to
be honest it's it's had a lot of issues
I think they're about a hundred and
fifteen on it now but I did buy it used
[Music]
that's why I was confused by there there
were a lot of problems there were some
oil leaks there were some noises from
the engine there were some problems with
the brakes there was some kind of water
leak inside of it and that's why I was
confused by your notice because to me it
seemed like the car really you know it
was an older car and I purchased it as
an older car and that kind of thing so I
wasn't too worried about any kind of
warranty stuff
okay well we do cover vf+ up to 20 years
"old up to 250,000 miles I mean with the"
at the mileage here as you would still
qualify for enhance level coverage which
is a great level of coverage that would
cover engine and transmission the drive
axle seals and gasket and still cover
the turbo that's on there it'll also
take care like your heating air
conditioning the cooling system your
fuel an electrical system as well so
what you're saying is if I had problems
with those systems you'd be covering
those repairs so really this isn't going
to help me for the problems I'm having
with the car now well like you said
you're not gonna you're not gonna you're
not gonna cover anything that's already
existing with the vehicle well as I said
it's got oil leaks it's got all the
clutches acting a little weird the
brakes have problems there was a water
leak inside of it so how much would this
coverage cost me
so that that would be almost as much as
the car actually that's more than what I
paid for the car so why why even bother
covering a vehicle where the repairs
cost more than the vehicles just I was
just curious because like I said I got
this notice and I wondered how I got it
because I only told a few friends that I
had got in a new car but you know it
just seemed a little odd to me that I
was getting a notice about a warranty
for a vehicle that was out of warranty
and obviously needed a lot had some
mechanical issues
okay well thank you for your time all
right you have a good day
well they didn't try to send me
something tell me something I didn't
need and they obviously wanted to avoid
doing or saying anything illegal so it
is aboveboard it's a business that
apparently well I don't want to say
preys upon people that might be ignorant
but that's kind of the reason why I
wanted to make this phone call because I
know that people get these notices for
these things all the time and may be
ignorant of the fact of you know what
exactly is happening so you know
apparently these people well to me it
appeared that these people are above
board now I can't speak for what happens
when you actually make a claim about a
repair but as you heard if you're going
to make a claim about a repair it can't
be about something that's already
existing on the vehicle because that
would be fraudulent
but as you heard the coverage for my
vehicle for five years would be 49
hundred dollars on a good day that car
all fixed up the way it is now I would
say is probably worth five fifty five
hundred as far as the the cost of the
vehicle so it would cost almost as much
and given the repairs that I've put into
the Mini at least of this vintage it's
to me it seems like diminishing returns
so there you have it I call the warranty
company up to find out what they have to
say about my Mini Cooper that they
wanted to sell me an extended warranty
on there it is anyway if you have
automotive questions not covered in this
video eric the car guy comm link down in
the description i will also link other
information and videos down in the
description to keep you entertained so
please check the description for
additional information aside from that
be safe have fun stay dirty I'll see you
next time thanks so much for watching

IF YOU ARE A VICTIM IN THIS
"SCAM, CALL POLICE."
THEY BELIEVE THERE ARE MORE OUT
welcome back we have a help me Hank
consumer alert about a new and pretty
scary phone scam
yeah imposters calling with a fake story
about your social security number being
compromised so far Americans have lost
millions
here's helping Hank with what you need
to watch for these scammers are after
one thing your social security number
once they have that number they're
working to steal your identity and it
could cost you big time it's a scam
growing at a frightening rate people
pretending to be from the Social
Security Administration crying to get
your social security number and your
money
the FTC issued a brand new warning and
take a look at the numbers in 2017 3200
people reported this imposter scam
those people lost about two hundred and
ten thousand dollars total last year
thirty five thousand people reported the
scam to the FTC the money lost ten
million here's what one of those scam
call sounds four digits of your social
security number when you call to better
assist you with this issue now if I
don't hear a call from you we will have
to issue an arrest warrant under your
name and get you arrested
so scammers say your social security
number has been suspended due to
suspicious activity sometimes the
scammer wants to confirm the number to
reactivate it the scammer may even try
to tell you that your bank account is
about to be seized and may try to
confirm that number as well here's the
really tricky part the caller ID often
shows the real number of the Social
Security Administration 1-800 one two
one three the scammers are faking the
number so what should you do first your
social security number is not about to
be suspended the administration never
calls to threaten you your benefits or
to tell you that you have to wire them
money anyone who tells you that is a
scammer if you're worried or suspicious
hang up and call the Social Security
Administration yourself and
never give out your social security
number or your bank information or even
your credit card information to anyone
who contacts you out of the blue
now that scam is not only taking place
across the country but we're hearing
about it here in Metro Detroit that's
why we wanted you to be aware it's
important to share this information with
your family and friends so they know
when that call comes that it is in fact
a scammer
I'm Hank Winchester help me Hank there's
so many clever ways out there that they
try to get you that you really have to
have that defense mechanism up all the
time like don't just trust it first do a
little research before you give out any
information right and if you are a
boomer and you're watching us right now
and you have concerns about your aging
elderly parent make sure especially if
they live alone make sure that they are
taken care of and they know a minor
percent because they're usually the
major targets for these types of scams

I had a couple landlines at home and
like most of you I just got call after
caller caller telemarketers now I love
telephones I work on telephone systems
for a living so I didn't want to give
her my landlines right I want to protect
my telephone at home and one day just
out of desperation I just handed the
phone to my kid I said here son waste
this guy's time on the phone my son he
he hung up the phone immediately he said
dad he said a bad word and I thought
that was just an air conditioning guy
why was an air-conditioning guy swearing
at my 14 year old kid right so I I was
just I realized that these guys they
don't care and they get to do and say
whatever they want and I was just
disgusted I was so frustrated and it
feels like such an invasion of privacy
to just receive these calls over and
over right so I was done I was done with
telemarketing I was done with it now why
is telemarketing such a problem today
right because phones have been around
for 140 years so why now is this such a
problem well
economics really is the reason why right
it's now possible to have 30 people
sitting in a room anywhere in the world
calling into the United States all day
long okay that wasn't possible 20 years
ago now thanks to voice over IP and the
internet and all of that and it's
possible now to do that technology and
economics the other issue is caller ID
manipulation okay we all think of caller
ID manipulation is spoofing which is
true caller Ids can be manipulated by
the telephone system offering the call
needs to be able to set the caller ID
it's very necessary technology for the
call forwarding and call call find me
follow me features and your doctor when
he calls and tells you of an automated
doctor's appointment that machine is
calling on behalf of hundreds of other
doctors and so it needs to be able to
put the right caller ID on the call and
offer to you okay why isn't anybody
doing anything about this okay
so telemarketing why isn't anyone doing
anything well I'm sorry to say that you
probably would look to the phone
companies to do something about
telemarketing right but telephone
companies can't help you okay
asking the phone company not to deliver
telemarketing calls is like asking the
post office not to deliver junk mail
okay
the cleverly constructed on piece of
junk mail looks like regular mail to the
post office right think they haven't
they have to deliver it the only way
they would be able to tell if it's junk
mail or not would be to open the
envelope okay and the post office of
course isn't gonna open the envelope
well it's the same thing with phone
companies they don't want to open the
envelope that would be answering the
call for you before delivering it to you
right then
no telephone company wants to do that so
how about the government so the
government can enact laws like the
do-not-call list and the telephone
Consumer Protection Act and they can
take complaints like the Federal Trade
Commission takes complaints from
everyone for regarding telemarketing and
they do an effective job at that but
they also will occasionally make these
big high-profile busts like a few weeks
ago they busted up the fake IRS in India
calling into the USA right and so they
they can do these big giant operations
or it takes a lot of resources to do it
they can bust it up and there's a lot of
money involved in that one operation but
for every one of those are thousands of
other companies that are trying to sell
you credit card reduction or trying to
you know offering your free cruise or
things like that right so the government
just can't keep up with all of these
because these operations hide behind
fake caller IDs and they just can't be
found right they can't easily be found
anyway unless they're big big players
okay so the government can help you and
the telephone companies can't help you
so what's this gonna what's this gonna
look like in 10 or 20 years right when
the network is already crushed by
telemarketing what do we do what's gonna
happen how do we fix this telemarketing
thing what's it gonna take all right so
what it's going to take is a pirate okay
somebody thinking differently something
somebody from the outside sort of doing
so deploying some some new technology
and some new tools okay so getting back
to a telemarketer
swearing at my son um when I when I was
done with that call I said this is it I
got to do something about this and if
I'm gonna stop telemarketing at my house
I'm a telephone guy I work on phone
systems I should be able to fix this
okay so I created a little app that when
you call my house first a little
greeting answers and says hey if you're
real person punch a button and you'll
ring through to my house from after that
once you do it just one time your caller
ID is allowed every time so just punch a
button your ring through and I put that
in front and and then people could call
me they could punch buttering through
what I was surprised to find was that
stopped 100 percent of telemarketing all
telemarketing stopped at my house by
deploying that greeting but I was
looking in the logs and I and I noticed
that the telemarketers of course we're
still calling but they thought that that
greeting was an answering machine and so
they would just hang up and move on
right because telemarketers all use that
100% of all telemarketers use these
things called predictive dialers which
will dial tens hundreds thousands of
numbers per hour trying to find real
people and they find real people by you
know we say hello hello they said they
have predicted Alice's that's a real
person in custody or an agent if they
hear just a lot of noise like press one
and you'll ring through to my house they
think that's an answering machine and
they would just move on so I'm looking
in the logs I noticed that this
telemarketers would call several times a
day they might call four times in a row
they'll call in the evenings weekend's
weekdays mornings
whatever they would just call constantly
the same numbers would call at different
times a day and it reminded me that's
what this is okay it reminded me of the
the scene in Jurassic Park where a
Muldoon says that they're they're
attacking the defenses they're there
they're attacking defenses looking for
vulnerabilities right
so these telemarketers are they're
attacking my house at different times a
day looking for vulnerabilities right
they'll try spoofing my local area code
for the caller ID right they'll block
their caller ID they'll put up a fake
caller Ids in so trying to get me to
answer the phone they're trying to get
me to answer and and I said well that's
great my machine blocks their machine
but maybe
get that machine to trip just stumble a
little bit when it gets to my house
right before it moves on let's try to
get it to stumble a little bit okay and
I remember when I was a kid there was a
old cartoon about this plumber knocking
on the door and then a parrot inside hit
says who is it and the plumber says it's
the plumber I've come to fix the sink
okay this is 40 years ago right the
brain is a weird thing right this stayed
in my brain for 40 years and then
resurfaced when I got these
telemarketers knocking at my door and I
said well maybe I could build a parrot
that would do that kind of thing to a
telemarketer okay so I recorded just a
sound file just hollows and let's see
what happens okay hello hello hello hi
there we go so I said hello a couple
times their predictive dialer cut me to
an agent now I got an agent on the phone
and that's when it came to me what's the
most expensive part of a telemarketing
operation it's that human being that I
just got on the phone there's a lot of
open-source software and you don't need
a phone anymore just a headset in a
computer and that's your telemarketing
shop right but that human being is their
most expensive asset and my machine just
got that human being on the phone so
then I thought well Wow let's see if I
can keep that guy engaged let's see if I
can keep these telemarketers engage for
a little bit okay so then I said just
some so I you know I built a little
clever algorithm trying to turn to talk
to telemarketer right and I said
sometimes I said just in name things
right you know I was having trouble
concentrating because you found exactly
like somebody I want the heights go with
so sorry okay that part again so things
like that right so and of course I would
record these calls right cuz I'm tuning
this algorithm constantly and I have to
wait for telemarketers to call back
knowing telemarketers because I don't
want people I know to go into this thing
right so telemarketers would get into
this so it was a long development
process to be developing this thing but
I started posting a few of these calls
online and it turns out nobody likes
telemarketing right and so and the calls
were funny they're entertaining and
they're funny and so I then created some
new robots right in more of hello hello
hello
and now hello hello hello hello alright
so I got more robots and more voices and
now I'm providing a method for everyone
to use these robots for their own
telemarketers ok so now instead of
engaging with the telemarketer yourself
or yelling at them or hanging up the
phone or ignoring them
now these robots these Jolly Roger
telephone robots can now engage with the
telemarketers and here's some real
examples of what goes on here ok hello
yes hi yeah are you Richard yeah I I'll
be honest you're the first lady I've met
with the name of Richard if you're
trying to mess with me this is pretty
funny actually because most the time I
can tell when someone's messing with me
I'm pretty sure you're messing with me
sure something tells me you are yeah are
you busy you're talking on another phone
are you playing a game for God's sake
uh-huh are you enjoying this no what
were you saying I'm asking you to verify
your address for the last four of your
social not just say yeah every time I
ask sure yeah sir sir okay let me finish
the question before you say yes and yes

Clinton right you say this conversation

over who this why are you calling I'm
not gonna do that I have to get these
questions done can you please not talk

the question yeah okay what is your
opinion of Hillary Clinton right mm-hmm
yeah like this might be the weirdest
conversation I've ever had with angling
yeah I feel like this conversation has
gone nowhere
doubtful Pegasus are we actually being
serious going on here are you trying to
waste my time when I get paid to speak
on the phone I told you I have much time
to waste it but why are you in your line
you don't have any well you're a judge
oh you know what sir I'm actually gonna
keep the money and I'm gonna give it to
somebody else because I don't like when
people play around my agents on the
phone phone you don't qualify for this
with that kind of attitude you have a
better okay sir you're obviously messing
with me I'm on track for this quarter to
make pretty close to one hundred and
eighty thousand for for this year I'm
getting paid we can do this all day
sure so this is basically like taking a
break for me hang up the call yes
another body yes very cool yeah finally
read me the credit card number you know
what you are just here to waste my time
and right now to think what you are
doing right now today I'm telling you
the very truth sure I won't take this
number off of the computer and you will
receive this okay I'm getting paid for
this sure of getting paid good money for
this
mm-hmm oh geez hang on there's a bee on
me hang on is it be on my arm you know
what are you playing you can solve it
I'm gonna talk though go ahead and keep
talking say that part again and I'm just
gonna stay quiet does this be
you know I think you're playing with me
mr. carton are you having fun with me
this morning yeah it's good I like fun
laughter is a good thing but let me ask
you this are you a homeowner
so these telemarketers are programmed
right are you no can't get her off her
program right they're programmed as
rigidly as my robots are right so now we
have pirate sailing the open waters of
the telecom network protecting the
consumer against telemarketers right and
and here we are protecting all geez hang
on there's a bi can you start over
what were you saying during the B so the
Jolly Roger telephone companies out
there when telemarketers encounter these
robots first of all they don't know when
they'll encounter them and when they
encounter a robot it's in their best
interest to stop calling you now right
and so these are protecting protecting
you and the consumer from telemarketing
and it's my pleasure to provide this
service so thank you very much
[Applause]
[Music]
do you remember what I'm saying mrs.
Hernandez
I am listening sir what's going on
listen to me first and if you want to up
any put a cushion
this is all about your federal income
tax yeah I guess I do according to your
files yes according to your files the
outstanding amount is three thousand
nine hundred and eighty seven dollar
money to pay them it's a huge amount for
me for my economy if you know what I
mean like Thanksgiving Day in Black
Friday Cyber Monday I don't have
thousand don't have anything to do with
this calculation no what do you mean by
it's like a woman whose name is
calculation so your cows are like
miscalculation you want to resolve this
case you want to prostate or you want to
decline it just tell me I want to fix it
I don't know I want to resolve these
days
listen carefully first all right there
is a to option to resolve this case the
first option is you can hire a criminal
lawyer or a thorny and fight this case
against the IRS inside the courthouse
and if you found guilty the penalty will
"be $75,000"
and this option was like a car park
sorry the second option was you can also
resolve this case outside the courthouse
without freezing any legal consequences
what option you want to brave her which
one is the third option the second
option was you can also resolve this
case outside the courthouse without
raising any legal consequences option
number three what is it there is a -
optional need to resolve this case which
option you want to pray for how would
you like to resolve it
why can you come up with a third option
like seriously mrs. Hernandez hang up

miscalculation means when you father -
you did not be the correct amount for
"example if you are supposed to be $1,000"
to the heiress and if you just come up
with $700 so their remaining about three

[Music]
a little while ago a viewer sent me a
message saying that they had almost
fallen for this scam they use QuickBooks
in their small business and they needed
some help migrating things since they
were going to be working from home and
when they went online and searched for a
QuickBooks support they thought that
they had found the right place but
ultimately found a scammer thankfully
they were familiar with some of this
stuff that scammers do and ended up not
falling for it but it encouraged me to
call a handful of these scammers over
the past few months and I realized I
never really made any youtube videos
about it
it starts with fake websites and links
even Google ads like this one where they
change the I in QuickBooks to an L they
even have websites that try to match the
QuickBooks and Intuit color scheme to
trick you they then connect your
computer to try to diagnose your problem
and will come up with fake errors and
network issues that need to be solved
but usually are charging thousands of
dollars to recover your data files for
your business multiple people have
reached out to me referencing this scam
saying they almost fell for it so it can
only imagine that there are people who
are involved in a small business or
maybe even a larger business who have
contacted scammers like this and fallen
for their tricks just wait a moment
so over the weekend we had some issues
at the building that first we lost a lot
of our backups and a lot of them a lot
of sensitive information and now my
accountants are saying that they can't
get access to the configuration and the
data and all that and I don't know if
that's something that you guys have
access to or being a make backups
yourself or can help me get a cue like
what with the word B but with the word B
recovers and which QuickBooks are you
using sir is that the pro premiere yeah
pro 24 looks crew 2020 how many users do
we have sir there's just three what is
the name of your business
yes Craig's landscaping Emporium
[Music]
so when you're using the quick book like
you are not able to use the QuickBooks
right now is that right sir
correct correct we're looking for
someone to help me here recover the data
files or whatever you would call it and
whatever data file like where the data
point was stored was that on your
computer or on a cloud I wish I knew the
answer is we we had this this guy who
helped us set up automated backup to
this little doohickey that's connected
to the Rooter in the office he said like
every night around a certain time it's
supposed to go there and back up yeah I
remember back I remember back when we
were using the floppy disk to back
things if you remember that yeah oh yeah
okay boomer I'll just take this up so
please hold on okay I need to first of
all pull up your account and what does
the name of name of your business that
you told me Craig's landscape Emporium
Incorporated and you said you are the
business owner correct

missed the call from hearing a while ago

call for me like literally like a minute
ago you're talking about yes just a few
seconds ago oh wait
really okay yeah I was actually just
talking to someone over there they were
trying to help me out with my computer
here I'm having trouble getting access
to my backup file okay so do you
remember the name of the person to whom
you were speaking earlier I don't think
he ever gave me the name I don't mind
working with you to be honest okay not a
problem a know which poison off could be
they using right now Pro 20 20 20 20
may I have the license number of your
QuickBooks you sure can let me see if
I'm trying to open I just try to
reinstall it to see if they would help
me get access to it but so what I was
saying is unfortunately these scammers
have a lot of ways to detect if they're
being scammed baited to like it's nuts I
hate to say it but it's like I'm pretty
good how like you have to have it they
might be looking up these businesses
video computer right another person who
to whom you were speaking earlier is
connected with your computer right now
no no it doesn't look like it I mean you
go to the website which is one two three
rescue dot-com they first used number of
uses like someone who's a serious
QuickBooks user all this stuff would be
you know so I have to
really sell that I had a big problem
my name is Co sir it's s isn't some as
an indigo why honey on key is and also
OC yeah yes nice to meet you see it I
should have said it's good to see you
see ya okay it's a support connection
enter your 6-digit came down you're not
much you're not related to the SIA or
you like the singer okay Midori can't
alien lament answered that you can
understand what I'm trying to say you
hear is that any kind of a network
glitch or any power failures may cause
any kind of a network damage so when
your data is getting shared through the
network or the other computers so the
network glitch that means let's say that
you lost the power
all of a sudden so when you lost the
power during that time if your computers
are connected and all the computers are
communicating with each other so when it
get disconnect the network the computer
lost the connection and after few
seconds or maybe after a minute or fact
a few minutes when it tried to
reestablish that network connection so
you can actual the computers during that
time when it disconnect and try to rig a
reconnect
during that process of disconnecting and
reconnecting the databases streams who
thinks the data on the network between
your computers that gets damaged which
causes any kind of a data damage data
corruption or any kind of a glitch so
the data should be there on the computer
but it becomes unreadable because of a
damage or because of any error which may
have happened
okay so dated damage might be damaged if
there's a dated glitch you're saying
because it yeah answer I can see that
your files were there okay
on the network but I need to find out
that why your quick book is not sending
the files like I said I reinstalled this
I reinstalled this mm-hmm
letting in my power so you can see here
this error it's saying about your quick
book up it's saying could look up
instead initializing great book on the
second point it's saying that the lid
config file of your grade book was
either not found or it's corrupt when
it's trying to attempt that well oh my
god you're saying that I can't find my
power so the files were there but it's
in a damaged condition that's the reason
that you cannot access these files okay
so you're saying it's not that the
backup is missing it's that there's a
lack of is not missing the backup is
there but but there is a data damage
which has happened due to that it's it's
not reading your files okay again I hate
to say it but doesn't it feel like
somewhat impressive you know if they
seemed fairly professional they're doing
things on your computer that aren't
running the command prompt and typing
tree and saying your network is
corrupted but it's still not valid like
it's this isn't real quick book support
obviously I don't have there is no
backup file I don't have a business I've
never used QuickBooks before but she's
going along with it and saying that
oh yeah due to this initializing oh my
gosh do you see that right there oh wow
it looks like you uh yeah your dad has
definitely corrupted let's see if we can
help you out with it's it's pretty if
you didn't know a lot about and now
she's just searching for errors she's
really just I don't know sir it's saying
here the login trees which I'm checking
here the report it's saying there's a
error encountered during the migration
for the data
the result is - for the error that means
it's level two it's not level three
because in technical terms there three
is specification for any kind of error
if it's level one error that means your
data may have some glitch which can be
fixed if we try to rebuild if it's level
two that means it has a damage where
it's recoverable we need to do the data
Ripper and if it says level three error
that means the data is corrupt which
cannot be repaired 100% data recovery
with the level three error is not
possible okay say what level do I have
where does it say what level I have I'll
show you just a moment how does that how
does the data get get a glitch where's
the later glitch what is that sir the
most common reason is a network light
here comes a vampeer
unfortunately I have the Event Viewer
service turned off what any kind of a
power failure network words when your
network conflict or any kind of a hard
hard disk crash or any backs off doable
here they can cause these problem they
can escape the longer feels processor
yes to means it's damaged but it can be
fixed it can be repaired if it's level 3
that means it's not recoverable if we
try to recover but it still there is no
guarantee that percent data recovery can
be done no and one it was maybe one
equals that there is no repair is
required only we have to run the data
rebuilt and it can fix the problem by
two means no or yes yes three means yes
no no three means no and one means three
means it cannot be fixed though we would
try but we would not give you the
assuras
that haunted poses
is now dreamy yes this is so confusing
you should have made it so one mean two
is bad memories yes level one let me
make it easy for you alright so just
kind of work with the data services they
are saying there are two options so
please let me know would you like to
send the data physically to us in the
data center or would you like to get the
repairs done online I don't know what
those mean pin it to you are you saying
that you want me to go hand-deliver I
can tell you what the difference is no
the difference is if you would if you
would like to get the repairs done from
our data center that means you have to
send the file through the FedEx or
through the mail
it was in the service center and the
time process it gonna take seven to ten
days for the data Reaper if you will be
mailing us or if you will be sending it
to work physically option B is for the
online repair that would save two to
four hours depending on the C vit and
your internet is speed it will take two
to four hours and deployed by the team
will gonna repair the data in in a day
as well within free words
okay so what's the difference between
the seven hundred dollar one-time thing
and the one year and 999 I mean that's
not like two hundred dollars lower yes
so there are two difference the first
thing is that this is an incident
support okay
incident means only for a day that means
when your issue will get resolved we
will close the case as resolved next
time any further hip regarding the data
will cost you again next time let's say
after anytime you face a problem within
a year anytime you can call us they will
fix the problem
and you don't need to pay any charge and
the major difference is that option a
will
take seven to ten days and option B will
take only two to four hours okay that's
fine so the payment option for Quickbook
Data Services is the each ech
you cannot use a debit or credit card to
make the payments you need to use the
electronic shopper
so the files are being mentioned with
the mb side if it is less than 200 mb
then only you can send as attachment to
us if the file size is more than 200 mb
then you need to send the files
physically to us in a thumb drive or
enough EDF how do you think it's do you
think it's a GB GB
I'm talking about the MB KB site
okay what's an NB I'm sorry what's the
difference between an ambien a GB so
this is what technical I don't
understand I don't know what's giving me
the heebie jeebies I don't know what to
do okay listen ma'am I appreciate your
help right now but all I wanted to do
was get access to my data file let me
ask you a different question because I
don't think let me ask it differently
because I don't think you understand
what I'm saying so it costs $700 for you
to accept my data and fix it so I can
use it again you're not understanding it
did you just call me drunk ma'am
no I said sir you maybe did not
understand what I explained you earlier

Daedra file I don't want you to I want

a look on it and read it and repair my
data for $700 that's this so this is
what this is so this is the only option

um i'm mostly alone uh grandpa's
sleeping
in the living room but he can't hear
anything
okay miss phil's and now listen to me
carefully and don't be so panicked
okay now let's first listen to me
carefully i'm just reading the affidavit
papers for you us customs
and border protection has seized a
suspicious parcel
which was shipped with the tracking
number ending with 7789
using united states postal service under
your name from the state of texas
now they scan the parcel and they found
out that
it was containing drugs cash worth of
one hundred thousand dollars
and a few fake travel licenses wow so
they
informed the drug enforcement
administration
as it was containing drugs and have
served the notice to united states
postal service
on further investigation they found out
that a
few other parcels were also sent to
different addresses in united states
which is also under your name in the
last few weeks
so fbi rates were carried out in seven
states
and they found out 14 different bank
debit cards
fake social security cards and also fake
driver license
they found out that your identification
was being used for the drug trafficking
in united states
and they collected all evidence and
documents from the crime site
further the documents which they
collected had a bank statements from
different banks
under your name in which a several big
transactions were made in a cache
and wired outside the united states so
when contacted with the tax department
regarding the cash
which was under your name it was found
out that there were mistakes in filing
of your tax returns
and you under reported a several cash
transactions
so at this point of time they have
already informed
don't worry just listen to me carefully
just listen to me carefully at this
point of time
they have already informed the social
security administration
and your bank to freeze all the benefits
and bank accounts
which was under your name and once it is
done you will not be
able to move any amount of your money or
your property till the case is going on
also they will inform to your employers
regarding this case so that they are
aware of the matter
so the u.s customs and border protection
is pressing three serious charges
against your name
that is count one violation of
controlled drugs and substance acts
count to violation of proceeds of money
laundering gas
country willful misrepresentation of
information to the government body now
before filing your paperwork into the
third house
we wanted to hear your side of the story
and if you feel guilty
hello yes okay now miss first what that
means for you is
you have to face an imprisonment of next
30 years as
drug trafficking and money laundering is
a serious crime in the united states
i'm good in department walmart or lane
on your assets
including your house and your car if you
own any
all your known bank accounts could be
frozen and confiscated which means
you would not be able to access your
bank accounts till the time
it is frozen your name could be
blacklisted permanently which means that
you would not be eligible for any of the
government benefits
the credit reporting agencies would be
notified about this money laundering
case
all your wages and benefits would be
frozen by informing your employers and
government bodies
your passport and your driver's license
will be cancelled if you have one
so you cannot run away from the
situation
so now this is to inform you that under
battery attack
you were under surveillance and all your
movements
your phone calls and your social media
postings were federally monitored by the
federal bureau of investigations
as you were considered as a threat to
the national security and we have
gathered enough evidence which we will
produce in front of church and yuri
members
so now miss first do you have any
questions before we proceed with the
legal straps against your name
yes
yes go ahead what taxes did i under
report what
what is that about
what did you say you you said i under
reported
my taxes
yes miss post there are some illegal
money which is under your name
and you have reported that money as a
legal one
i didn't report any thing but legal
money that's all i have
that's all i have and that's what i
reported
okay and go ahead with your another
questions you said i'm being charged
with
misinformation when i have not given any
misinformation to
anyone how is it possible
listen we found out some uh illegal
and some fake identifications which was
made
under your name like fake social
security cards and fake
driver's license and for that you are
being charged
but i didn't do anything
so at this point of time you are telling
me on this federally recorded line that
you have not done any of these things
and you are the innocent of course i
haven't done any of these things
i'm not that confident okay so miss phil
okay miss fools as i told you this is
the criminal and investigation under
your name
so at this point of time i have few
questions which you need to answer me so
please be sure that you are answering it
honestly
okay okay miss filth my very first
question is to you that is there anyone
who is a drug
addict around you like your friends your
family mates
your colleagues anyone a drug addict or
a drug seller
uh well not really i mean i have a
couple friends that smoke a little
marijuana sometimes but
that's about it
okay so my next question is
have you ever lost recently your wallet
or your cell phones
with your personal information uh yeah
i lost my wallet like three weeks ago
and have you reported it to the police
department
no i didn't report it to the police i
um went to the lost and found
okay and uh you know the crooks are too
smart nowadays they can duplicate your
identification in couple of hours
no i didn't know that okay and do you
do you have any knowledge of receiving
or sending any unknown packages
using united states postal service
no okay and have you applied online for
payday loans
personal loans or credit cards recently
where you need to provide your photo
identification or any of your personal
information
no i have not
okay and now listen to me carefully do
you remember of opening an account in a
bank of america or
wells fargo before to move two weeks
i'm sorry what do you remember of
opening an accounting and bank of
america or in wells fargo before two
weeks
no now listen the information which we
have from
our detective stating that the bank of
america account and the wells fargo
account which was open
under your name before two weeks which
has a total balance of
six hundred thousand dollars and that is
the account which was used for the money
laundering
so that this money belongs to you and do
you claim for that account
no i have nothing to do with that
okay so from this investigation now what
we believe is that there might be a
possibility that someone has an access
to your personal information
and they might be using your
identification to do the criminal
activities in the united states and you
might be a victim to the identity tap so
do you
understand what we are trying to explain
to you
and do you feel that you are a victim to
the identity theft
well it would make sense because i
didn't commit any of these acts i
i mean i didn't do anything so i don't
know
what to say other than i didn't do
anything
okay so now um what we can do
that uh what we have to do now is we
have to go and differentiate
exactly that what information is true
and what information
is fact because you said you've been
monitoring me correct so
you've seen that i haven't i haven't had
any activity that's personally connected
to me
right relation
whatever information the government is
having
is all the fraud information and all the
mix of information
about you so i just want to ask you some
more couple of question over this
recorded line
so that i can come to a conclusion that
are you a criminal or not and i can
resolve
your case so do you understand yeah
yes and i need you to be honest and
cooperative like
like you are you are cooperating me i'm
trying yeah
[Music]
my very first question is to you do you
have any suspect on anyone that who can
do this with you
who can use your identification i don't
know how many
addresses listen how many addresses are
linked
under your name
just one
i i can listen some sound around you who
is there
that's grandpa i told you he's sleeping
but he can't hear anything he's deaf so
okay okay son can
where are you right now uh i am at three
five two zero hickox road
three five two zero yeah after three
five two zero what was that decox road
how did well out there
75089 eight seven five zero eight nine
six nine eight nine okay miss first and
how many cars do you hold under your
position
uh i don't have a car
okay you don't hold any car and uh do
your grandpa hold any cars
which you are using yeah he has a car
okay and do you hold a driving license
or not yeah
i have a driving license
that's good and how many financial
institutes you are banking with
currently
just one oh can i know the name of the
bank is this
a bank of america which is having the
six hundred thousand dollars
no then i'm sorry
can you please verify me with your name
off the bank
yeah td bank that's the td bank
and under your td bank do you hold the
checkings or run savings or do you hold
both of the accounts
both okay and for an approximate amount
how much do you hold in your checkings
and your savings
um i'm not really
sure um i'm just asking you for the
approximate amount
so that i can mention that amount in
your resolvement problems and send it to
the department of treasury
uh my checking account i think there's
around
um
i think there's just a little over two
thousand
because that's like i wrote checks today
it's the first
so like there's payments that haven't
gone through my account yet
so it kind of shows that there's more
money than i really
have does that make sense okay
so and under your savings account how
much do you hold an approximate amount
uh savings is
like 3 000.
okay and do you hold any plastic cards
like mastercard
credit card prepaid cards under your
name
no you don't hold any calls and
do you hold any ira or 401k account
under your name
yeah yes okay and for an approximate
amount how much you hold and which
account do you have it's an ira or 401k
uh it's of uh individual retirement
okay that's an ira yeah
okay and for an approximate amount how
much do you hold in your ira
i'm sorry i don't know you don't know
the approximate amount also
i don't okay and uh
for an approximate amount how much cash
do you hold with you
um a couple hundred dollars probably
okay so i can mention like three hundred
dollars
okay i'm just mentioning two hundred
dollars
okay miss first now thank you for the
information now what i have to do is
i have to forward this information to
the department of treasury for your
asset verification
and i have to explain this situation to
them that you are the person who is
facing the
identity theft and you are not the
person who is doing the criminal
activities

moment let me talk with the department
of treasury
another line and after that i will just
transfer your call to the higher
authority department who can help you
out in a better way
till that what you have to do you cannot
put me on a hold or a mute or a loud
speaker
and you are not supposed to disclose any
of the information to the third party
why am i asking you so because at this
point of time the government
is not trusting any of the third party
as you are facing the problems
for the identity theft and there might
be anyone who can use your
identification for some sack of money
did you understand that
my identification for some sack of money

yeah
okay okay now i just verified your all
the information
with the department of a treasury and
the treasury department
has verified your asset and they
also found out that there are no
criminal allegation
against your name in the past which are
against
the government or related to money
laundering or a drug trafficking case
[Music]
sorry not before today mr anderson said
there was four allegations pressed
against me today
yes ma'am yes ma'am because whichever
things
we are having over here is all under
your name
not the criminal name who is doing this
activity
right now you are the suspect of this
activity
and you need to cooperate with the
government bodies
to take care of the situation i'm trying
okay now at this point of time uh
i just verified your information over
here
with the treasury department so on the
basis
of that there is only one option
provided to you by the department of
treasury which is adr
option which stands for alternative
dispute restitution under the adr
option the government is giving you what
two ways
to handle the situation number one
is by going public and number two is
maintaining a privacy
i will read out both the option for you
you have to select
that which option you would like to go
and resolve the problem
under your name okay okay
so now your option number one is going
public
public means there will be article
in tomorrow's leading newspaper with
your photo feature
the incidents that you are involved in
the money laundering
and drug trafficking and whole nation
will know about this thing
which means all your property and your
bank accounts
will be freezed and you have to prove
the source of the asset you have
approximately hold on which will take
approximately
one year of your time to get it resolved
and all your creditors will be informed
which means
if you have borrowed any money in the
form of loan
mortgage you have to repay them
immediately
because after the articles in the
newspaper
they will not wait anymore for their
money to recover
this is the option number one going
public
the option number two hello yes
you don't have to answer any call or
anything okay
just listen to me okay the second
option is maintaining a privacy in a
privacy matter
means that it will be between you and me
and your resolvement will be done in the
next full working
hour without anyone knowing it
in that you have to maintain a secrecy
no other party should know about this
resolvement from your side
you just have to follow the guideline
laid down by us
and i will make sure i will take out you
from this case in the next
three to four working hour so can you
tell me that which option you would like
to go
and resolve the problem under your name
i don't want to go public
okay so you want to go by option number
two
yeah maintaining a privacy right privacy
yes
okay now as you select option number two
privacy
you know that your state id and your
name is the prime
evidence of this case right now
all of your liquid asset which means
treasury department
will take over your asset under them
for two to three hours by converting
your money
into the digital bonds the reason you
will have to convert
your money into the digital bonds is
because
your state id your or your name
will be not related or not be there
on that digital bond which you will
submit to the department of
treasury and once you will safeguard
all of your liquid asset and the money
the department of a treasury will
issue a new state id and a new safe bank
account sunday only
in which all of your money will be
safely deposited by the government
why the government is giving you this
chance because
we need to go ahead and we need to put a
freeze under your name right now
to freeze that black money which is not
belongings to you
we need to freeze that black money ma'am
right now
and once we will put a freeze under your
name
you will lose your banking information
and you will lose your heart and money
and your savings that's the reason the
government is telling you
to move your money into the digital
bonds
for the next two hours okay and after
two hours the government will gonna
issue a new bank account so
all the money will be safely deposited
in the new bank account
so would you like to go ahead and would
you like to convert
your money into the digital bonds or not
um i guess so how do i do that
yeah the that is the information i will
give you step by step okay
now i'm giving you one brief explanation
what you need to do okay
now what you need to do is you need to
go to your bank you need to withdraw
all the money in the form of cash
once you have the money in the cash with
you you need to convert it
into the digital bonds which you can
purchase
from the government certified school
like do you
do you know what is government certified
store
no i have not heard of that what is it
okay the government certified stores
means like a walmart
cvs walgreen dollar general
target best buy this is a government
certified store
which you can go and which you can
purchase the digital bond
those are government certified stores
i don't understand that those are
government certified
stores i thought they were yes they are
carrying
they are carrying they are sorry
i thought they were just department
stores owned by different companies
no ma'am that is by from the government
the government is giving a permission to
run the business
okay any business you want to do the
government
will give the permission for that okay i
thought that was on the state level
you have to apply for a state business
license
okay once you purchase the digital bond
you have to provide me the bond
registration number so i can register it
with the department of of treasury
on our central panel and once i will
register
all the bonds with them the department
of treasury will send me
a resolution letter to the nearest
government building
and i will give you the confirmation for
your apartment
you have to go there and you have to
collect your resolution letter
and the certificate from the department
of a treasury
in the government office which is
declaring that the money
which you have in the digital bonds are
clean money

[Music]
border protection scam there you go
script is uh pretty much as complicated
as
ssa but there's a new script
be sure to warn your people don't fall
for scams
peace and love
[Music]
you
this is your marketplace
exclusive access catching the scammers
in our backyard it certainly helped CBC
did their expose or episode on
marketplace first the CRA scan I fed
them the inside story from India we were
trained like that who pretend to be
legen our iris officer then tracking the
tech support scam why do you do this
illegally what does it say that we were
able to get inside calls for action make
sure that Canadians are protected
organized criminals and the scams won't
stop their money laundering
CRA scam tech support scams sin skin all
connected feeding on each other's leads
revealed only on your marketplace
[Music]
just outside Toronto federal agents are
gearing up the rest go after months of
investigation they're about to carry out
key arrests way comes Oh we'll be
cracking down on an international scale
targeting Canadians safety we have
exclusive access to witness this
takedown rates 2 a.m. we've just got the
call we've been waiting months to
receive we knew the Mounties have been
watching alleged scammers and how they
tell us they're ready to move in in some
ways this began two years ago with an
investigation of our own on the other
side of the world it's a scam Canadians
know all too well not the real Canada
Revenue Agency but one of the largest
cyber schemes in Canadian history
there will be legal as we work to locate
the scam centers in Mumbai India we met
up with a whistleblower who previously
worked inside one
Jayesh Dube it was big money yeah it was
big money more than you would make
anywhere else I can only get anywhere no
easy to read the script threatened the
person on the other end of the line all
while impersonating an American tax
agent thank you for calling IRS home LP
so we were trained like that to become
an IRS officer to pretend to be like an
hourish officer you're threatening
people you're saying they could go to
jail they could get arrested do you
could get arrested if you cry to fight
against the IRS then the penalty is
"$75,000 which you can never pay and your"
assets and all is going to get please we
track calls like that to a scam center
inside this building
[Music]
but when our local helpers knock on the
door so the the call center has moved
out they some of they realized someone
was on to them it turns out the danger
is still there
so it's now clear to us this area is
dangerous that we need to get out that
we're being watched and other people who
went into the building for us they're
being followed it all shows how
dangerous these scammers can be why do
you think they were following him we
still have questions how do the scammers
know who to call
how do they get money from victims could
it be there's an accomplice at the top
in Canada
Jahangir rashidi has those same
questions how did this start with one
call phone call they call and they said
this is Revenue Canada and Government of
Canada lawsuit view for ninety nine
thousand five hundred dollar what did
you think when you heard it's a huge
amount I said I don't have it he said go
and borrow from the bank go to your
friend go to your employee go wherever
you can make money doesn't matter just
you have to pay you have to pay you pay
he's from Iran where the government
actually does make demands like this he
worried the call was legit and paid big
one hundred and ten thousand altogether
forty five thousand was my RSP and then
five thousand dollar my saving account
"$4,000 for my last paycheck checking"
"account $5,000 from my son"
and the rest credit card long line of
credit is life savings gone back in
India so how long have you been police
commissioner here top cop Paramveer
Singh says the scam kingpins are leading
a rich light one of the main accused he
had a very high-profile lifestyle he was
probably thinking about buying a private
jet also at that point of time a private
jet he was thinking of buying one yes
funded by million stolen from victims
living in North America and Commissioner
Singh has another shocker about police
in Canada nobody contacted us from
Canada
no one's caught no one no one contacted
American authorities did contact us no
one contacted although on the website of
RCMP and we did see a post relating to
other cases once but you're telling me
"60,000 people at least have complained"
in Canada and nobody from Canada is
doing anything nobody pointed and the
only way you found out about it is by
going on the RCMP website yourself
that's right yeah
that doesn't seem right they don't
simply
when our story airs across Canada there
is outrage
can the Public Safety Minister explain
why Canadians have to depend on the CBC
to unearth this scam and protect
Canadians will the Prime Minister tell
us how we will follow up to ensure that
these calls stop and to make sure that
Canadians are protected against
organised criminals in India services
and intelligence agents to do what needs
to be done to protect Canadians at home
and overseas the RCMP later say they
have been talking to India but all this
attention puts the issue on the front
burner empowering more people to come
forward this is really scary this is
really scary my stomach was just at SEC
you feel thick a month after our story
taught brass order a special task force
be set up at this secure facility
outside Toronto we get inside the
headquarters but what the RCMP call
project Octavia it's essentially a
national priority investigation and
inspector Jim Ogden has a surprise
certainly what I know and what I can
share is that there are our known
targets leads when we get enough
evidence then we will charge and
prosecute these individuals and just so
I'm clear are we talking about people
who are in this country in Canada that's
correct
who are helping carry out this scam
that's correct they're defrauding the
Canadian public and sending it sending
it away they're their money laundry
while the Mounties focus on tracking the
Canadians connected to this crime
our trail took us back to India a year
after our first investigation into the
CRA scam and we closed in on the call
centers carrying out another one this
time we had something up our sleeve
hiring someone to sneak in a hidden
camera were the first to get inside the
tech support scam with criminals using
scare tactics to demand payment for a
computer fix you likely don't need what
made you think this was legitimate he
sounded genuinely concerned and led me
to believe that he could fix the problem
when Diane begins Facebook account stops
working she calls up a number she thinks
is for Facebook support but ends up with
a convincing scammer instead when you
look back on it now how do you feel
about it I was vulnerable at the time
and I was impulsive yeah and I feel very
violated that they had access to
everything on our computer our laws
should protect us against things like
this
after months of our own investigation
we're ready to confront those targeting
Canadians which is amazing to think it's
right here
back in India we've seen the scammers
can be dangerous so we're moving quickly
[Music]
the company whose name is at this
address says this is a legitimate
operation but we know some of the people
inside are running a scam why do you
have a call center here
why do you do this illegally we want to
talk to top bosses there are real
victims real victims these are real
people who cannot afford to lose this
money you're taking it from them it
seems no one here wants to talk to us at
least while we're here they're off the
phones anyone want to say anything
nobody okay
back in Canada we share our findings
with the RCMP s highest-ranking
Financial Crimes official superintendent
Peter Payne what does it say that we
were able to get inside a call center
like this yeah no I applaud your efforts
for getting in there but once again
police alone cannot solve this issue
there's lots of call centers over what
do you say to the scammers were over
there if you think they're unstoppable
uh we're not giving up this battle turns
out that's a bit of foreshadowing the
Mounties know there are accomplices in
Canada they know who they are we're
about to find out too
this is your market place on the roads
outside Toronto a man has no idea police
are on his tail the RCMP closing in on
Canadians they say are accomplices in an
enormous cyber scheme and we're about to
witness it all go down we're just
outside the RCMP secure facility after
months of investigation into some of the
largest cyber schemes in Canadian
history they're ready to take action and
these are schemes like the CRA scam the
tech support scam the bank investigators
scanned the syn card scam
all of it coming to a head early this
morning we started our investigation in
October of 2018 inspector Jim Ogden
oversees project Octavia the specialists
unit investigating oversees call center
scams my message is that we'll find you
and we'll we'll further investigate and
we'll we'll charge where we can
we've traced many of these scams back to
India like the tech support scam how
much money was stolen from you three
thousand three thousand dollars when now
hid fill opposes phone stops working she
Google's a solution and calls the number
that appears on her screen he went onto
the phone and he said there are many
problems on the phone there are hackers
from Russia from India from Brazil he
said all that about your phone yeah he
said it's a complicated issue we need to
work on this phone has to be minimum
three thousand dollars to be able to do
the transaction now he pays on her money
gone I said where's my money is where
does one money are you with this
converse are you thieves he's then hung
up the phone then I tied the game like
ten times twelve times nobody want to
answer even as police close in on
multiple scams the scammers are adapting
adding a new scheme involving Canadian
Social Insurance numbers we just
offended your social insurance number
and legal enforcement action will be
taken against you as we found some
suspicious activities and law
enforcement is getting help from a big
name in the tech world that's bringing
us back to Microsoft headquarters near
Seattle and the inside its Digital
Crimes Unit we were here a year ago
checking out how artificial intelligence
is helping trace the scammers this is a
very profitable crime with a very low
risk of prosecution we need to invert
that equation lawyer one hard way
overseas the global unit here feeding
tips and evidence to India over the last
ten months
Indian law enforcement has dismantled
ferry call centers has brought to
justice
seventy two directors of call centers
there but Microsoft tells us while there
have been arrests in India there hasn't
been one conviction of a scam boss since
2014 you got this letter right
show me that that's really interesting
but Hardaway says they're not giving up
continuing their war with the scammers
he says Microsoft gets a complaint of
someone impersonating their agents every
seven minutes but guys are now selling
calls for call centers to exploit it's
almost like a scam franchise exactly and
it has evolved into that because there's
so much money to be made and as I said
the profits are so big relative to the
investment our own investigation has led
us to believe that there are people in
Canada
helping with this scam helping move
money and do other things is that
something that you understand as well
yeah that's correct
one trail leads to this house in
suburban Vancouver CBC the first to
discover court documents which accused
the man who lives here of retrieving the
money for a fraud connected to these
scams
he even allegedly moves approximately a
million dollars through his accounts
prosecutors say that is laundering the
proceeds of unlawful activity and are
trying to seize the house his father
owns it and denies any wrongdoing while
his son has now reportedly fled to China
we need to target the wallets of the bad
guys so that if the money stops flowing
they're not going to be able to keep
their operation running and they will go
out of business
Microsoft is targeting those money mules
and talking the Canadian police about
how to do it we're working with law
enforcement and with also other banks
financial services industries to
identify those bad bank accounts or
merchant accounts so that they can be
suspended and money be returned to
victims and they're not the only ones
Canadian police are hot on the case too
the Mounties are about to take down what
they call a super money mule a top-level
scam associate who lives right here in
Canada
who they are and how the Mounties found
them coming up
this is your marketplace it's a federal
raid our CMP officers about to move in
there on the tail of a man they say is a
big player in scam calls that plague
Canadians they took away my trust my
confidence everything now hid philipose
is a victim of one of those scams she's
waited a long time to see action who
should be trying to stop these guys
why done that what it is in Canada and
India cooperate together victims like
knobhead and all of us who get these
calls incessantly are about to see the
RCMP act
seconds after the target arrives at work
officers move in
we're not allowed to get any closer to
this Factory in Georgetown Northwest of
Toronto
as the man and the reflective jacket is
taken into custody everything in his
pockets placed in bags by police seems
he had no idea that he was being
surveilled that people police officers
were following him and they got him just
as he showed up for work we've agreed
not to identify the police since many of
them are undercover
the man is being charged with fraud
money laundering and property obtained
by crime we watch as he's taken away a
morning he'll probably never forget as
the man arrives at the RCMP headquarters
in Milton Ontario to be fingerprinted
and processed officers are on the phone
to his wife telling her she's wanted -
her husband already in custody she's
told to turn herself in
and were there when she arrives
[Music]
they were essentially money mules or
money mule managers that were receiving
bags of cash
RCMP inspector Jim Ogden tells us his
team's investigation shows this couple
was working directly with Indian
scammers and then essentially dispersing
it and making it accessible to those
that are running the illegal call
centers in India what helped get you to
this point today
the CBC Marketplace episode you did in
India certainly raised a flag for the
public safety minister and a senior
representatives in the RCMP at a later
news conference Gurinder Preet dhaliwal
37 years of age from Brampton Ontario
and inderpreet Delhi well 36 years of
age also from Branton are charged with
the following criminal offenses
one count of fraud over $5000 one count
of laundering the proceeds of crime and
one count of property obtained by crime
the Mounties reveal thousands of dollars
in cash more than a hundred thousand in
jewelry even a money counting machine
allegedly used by the couple the couple
have yet to appear in court to submit a
plea in response to the charges it's
about time a lot time guys we show
footage of the arrests tonight when you
see a guy like that in handcuffs I'm
happy definitely very happy about that
and I appreciate what the police has
done to do this this is a big victory
even if I'm not getting my money I'm
happy that an action is being taken for
other people to be saved this is very
important
kudos to the woman who knew interviewed
and was willing to come forward and tell
everything tell all victims need to see
that that they're not alone watching the
RCMP take down mark simcha s'en the
former head of a major fraud unit good
for them good for them well bloody time
this is something that you've waited a
long time to see are you surprised that
it's happened I wanted to have faith and
I'm glad they proved me right that's
kudos to them because that must have
been really difficult must have been
really difficult and kudos to
marketplace and hookahs because here are
the ones that instigated all of this in
my view what do you know the likelihood
is that these scam calls disappear not
very not very they're gonna continue the
frequency may drop may change why is
that because there's still victims here
that are vulnerable fraud is you know
it's theft with a smile the arrests
aren't over the RCMP say they're
targeting more people in Canada
and abroad this is gonna be a deterrent
for sure we're gonna get our
co-conspirators that are here in this
province thinking twice about well I
thought we were untouchable and they're
not
it's the counterfeit crackdown it says
in big red letters we don't sell any
fakes five companies 100 products I'm
shocked by me other people are just
happening too how many other people
don't even know this is happening
getting a good deal or getting ripped
off with us safe
and you follow the money it gets really
scary could the products be dangerous
lead and the chromium concentrations are
quite high
fighting back on your marketplace

"Keaton the Scammer, and woah,"

"any I-Phone, it would destroy your phone."
"And the only way to get around it,"
this is what they want you to do is

now your phone is the door scammers use
to talk you out of your money and with
the success of the fake IRS calls
they've now turned to faking calls about
your social security number box of
i-team's Dana file has examples of those
calls and a local student who nearly
fell into the trap Dana good morning she
did and I'm glad she called us and
wanted to tell her story here's how the
scammers start this whole thing
according to the Social Security
Administration they spoof the
administration's customer service number
which means they make it look like it's
really an official call then the game
begins it's urgent
the caller says your social security
number has been suspended in order to
get out of this jam you need to hand
over a lot of personal information
college student Tamara Kok field
answered her phone and that's how it all
started this is a taped social security
scam call and we got it from the Georgia
Department of Consumer Protection they
have a lot of them your social security
number has been suspended please contact
your emergency helpline number
tomorrow's call was similar and it was
scary
they said suspicious money-laundering
overseas and they said that you know if
I wasn't cooperating that there was
there's also an arrest warrant out for
me and of course you know adolescent
twenty-one-year-old like I freaked out
and just you know I went with it
and
everything I told me this scam caller
one of the last four digits of her
social security number he wanted to know
information from her driver's license
and they wanted to know how much money
she had in her bank accounts she told
them everything they were saying you
know for us to dispute your arrest
warrant we're gonna have to transfer you
over to your local police department and
that number was the exact same as well
they had spoofed that number as well and
led me to believe that I was actually
talking to someone up a department
finally she sent her sister a text
despite being warned by the caller not
to do that and they were saying on the
phone like Tamera if you're talking to
your family like that can put them in
dangerous her sister got her text s.o.s
and came to the rescue
her big sister told her it was a scam to
hang up and get busy protecting herself
the college senior went straight to her
bank
she changed every password she had put a
freeze on her credit and reported what
happened to her to the FTC who has a
warning on its website about this scam
you're a smart girl you've heard about
this before and they got yep yep it's
crazy it could happen anyone remember
the government which means the IRS the
Social Security Administration they're
not going to issue arrest warrants and
they're not going to send the police to
the house so just hang up no and it's
like stop and think about have you done
anything that would require you to be
arrest exact right stop ya think
just take a deep breath do what she did
call a trusted person and say does this
sound right to you because from the
outside looking in it's gonna be clearer
yeah you know one of the things say no
we were talking about earlier is you you
can't suspend your drug yes it's not
gonna get you can have your driver's
license suspended you can have a
business license suspended your social
security number is not gonna be
suspended certainly if there was a
problem with your social security number
in some way you would have gotten a call
first or have been reached out to via a
mail saying there's ID theft or
something this is just simply not how it
works take a step back look at the big
picture right all right helping us out

he's going to tell me that these errors
are caused probably about an hour but
they're not so I'm wondering if you can
find anything wrong in event viewer for
me okay sir it might be the network
securities all right is it Nick is a
nicotine met with security that all okay
I don't know can you tell me okay just
read it again so you're certified
Microsoft so where are you guys located

based out at the US sir okay look let me
check out the network connections and a
network security they're a little open
or not okay just
trying to get into ms config aren't you
oops command prompt I get it you know
you can get to that in the you can do it
that way or you can use right and ms
config and you can go into services and
you can try to tell me that these
services that are being stopped or
caused by malware which I'm not going to
believe because these are digitally
signed by Microsoft I mean these
services do you see these services here
that are being stopped and some of them
are better run it do you know that these
are a manually set you know in services
if you go into here we can go into a run
any right services MSC you could see the
ones that are being stopped services
don't MSC or set to manual here I just
wanted to I just wanted to know because
you know I do a little bit of computer
work as well and you can see there's
some that are running and some that are
being stopped but the ones that are set
to manual don't automatically run with
windows so you can see here and in here
that these ones are set to stop because
they're not manually set to run right
and they're digitally signed by
Microsoft is that true yeah the answer
is that's weird that's good but just how
I just want to tell you why this pop-ups
it's coming on your screens without that

Probably like six or seven is it
getting pretty annoying yeah

just yesterday
If your cell phone has been
ringing off the hook with
"numbers you don't recognize,"
you've got plenty of
company. Nearly everyone we
stopped to talk to has
experienced the same problem.
basically I've been getting
these calls from the 808 area
sometimes Washington and
California and it's been
happening a lot with my
classmates and friends
The spoof calls or robo calls
are an ongoing problem
"according to wireless carriers,"
a problem they're working to
address.
"KATIE SPENCER, AT&T: we are at"
AT&T know how annoying they are
obviously we get them ourselves
and
it's been one of our big
commitments to try to give
customers more control over
those unwanted calls
AT&T tells me they have a free
app available that can
help to keep the scam or spoof
calls from coming in.
it's a free app and basically
what it does is automatically
detect and blocked fraudulent
calls before they even get to
you
billions of robo calls since
2016
since that all launched we've
locked 2.8 million calls
obviously there's a lot of work
to be done because we all
still get those annoying calls
we are trying to make it better
A spokesperson from Verizon told
"me, it's also"
actively monitoring it's network
to detect spikes in
"suspicious calls, along with"
working with other companies to
develop new technologies to stop
robo calls.

Bullard for Comcast customers who might
start receiving automated phone calls
from a phone number with a 2-1 five area
code the scam involves this phone number
to one five two eight six 1700 so if
you're a Comcast customer and you see
that number on the caller ID the company
says you should not answer the phone
because it's a scam or trying to steal
your personal information News four
Jack's reporter Eric Hovind is joining
us live to explain how the scam works
and why one Comcast customer is lucky
Eric that he didn't become a victim well
imagine getting a call from that number
on your phone and hearing an automated
voice telling you that hackers from
another country have found a way to hack
into your IP address and that you need
to do something about it well that is
the phone call many Comcast customers
are receiving and if you're not careful
your personal information could end up
in the hands of a crook Robert
Abercrombie says on Saturday he received
four unusual phone calls within an hour
and a half of each other his caller ID
says the calls were from Comcast
the automated calls all had the same
message that my IP address had been
compromised through several countries
Abercrombie says the calls sounded
suspicious so he called Comcast customer
service and learned the calls he
received were actually part of a scam to
get his personal information they told
me that they knew of the situation and
the telephone numbers the number that
called Abercrombie is 2 1 5 to 8 6 1700
it's now on the Comcast security alert
website as to let customers know the
number is fake a call from this number
will ask for your account information
and tell you that your internet IP
address has been compromised Comcast is
warning customers not to fall for this
scam we're not gonna call you and ask
for your password we're not going to be
calling you to ask you to give us your
sensitive details over the phone or
asking you to send us things like your
account numbers or your social security
number or anything like that Comcast
says if you receive a phone call from
someone claiming to be a Comcast
employee and the call sounds suspicious
do not give out any personal information
that you need to immediately hang up the
phone and after you hang up the phone
make sure you call Comcast to alert them
of that
suspicious phone calls you can call us
at 100 Comcast or 1-800 Xfinity and that
way you know that you're actually
speaking with a Comcast Asian and we can
check your account as for Abercrombie
he's just glad he didn't fall prey to
the scam the last phone caller they gave
me an option a one to call so on to the
hang-up so I did push to now the number
in tonight's story is one of four
numbers identified by Comcast as a fake
number designed to deceive people into
giving up personal information we have
posted all four of those fake numbers
and here they are we've posted all four
those fake numbers to our website news

I'm you pick up the phone some locals
are getting phone calls that sound like
they're from Medicare but as they're
finding out it's not really Medicare at
all 13 consumer advocate Tricia Keene
explains what you need to know before
it's too late
very convincing and I said okay why
don't what you like to know
Martin guna recently received a call the
lady says that calling from Medicare we
want to go over your health insurance
you are Martin Thor now I said yes the
caller identified herself as Linda and
provided a Medicare ID number Martin
says she also had his address but to
confirm she was really speaking with
Martin
she asked for a key piece of information
give me your group number so you know
what that man I took out my card the
Medicare card and I took at the group
number
that's when Martin realized something
was fishy well the group number is my
social security number Martin says he
wasn't willing to give the caller his
social so he asked if he could call back
later but she wasn't willing to provide
her phone number I'll call you back and
she hung up five minutes later my wife
got the same call Martin told his wife
to hang up then he called and alerted
Medicare these scam artists can be very
smart Nevadas senior Medicare Patrol
confirms this was a bogus call and in an
effort to prevent possible identity
theft Medicare has been working to
remove Social Security numbers from all
membership cards new cards should be
coming out in Nevada really at any time
we are in the next wave for them to come
out but the changes led to a rise in
phony phone calls as thieves try taking
advantage of confused Medicare members
obviously Medicare will return your call
if you have an inquiry in with them but
but they're not going to call you out of
the blue to ask for your Medicare number
or your social security number and
that's a lesson Martin says we can all
use when answering a call from any
business better not to talk on the
telephone or give pertinent information
on the telephone for contact 13 I'm
Trisha Kean
some great advice there from Trisha if
you get a similar call Nevada's senior

telling her she has a virus but good
news for $400 they'll fix it it was sort
of like the light bulb went off because
I knew at that point what they were
offering wasn't wasn't true security
experts say these pop-up ads are
misleading and dangerous it looks like a
warning but it's not real it's just a
picture telling you there's something
wrong with your computer but there's not
actually something wrong with your
computer
all right we're going to try this for
ourselves we're going to call one of the
companies that sends those pop-up
warnings went to the store bought a
brand new MacBook Air laptop and you can
see it's right out of the box we brought
our computer expert in Jim Stickley here
if they tell us over the phone there's a
virus on this what does that mean it
means they're trying to rip us off or
even worse they might be trying put
their own malware on alright so I get my
phone we're gonna call them up
I saw a pop-up that's set to call this
number about a computer virus can you
help me the technician immediately asked
to tap into my computer and once he's in
we watch him poke around my laptop in
real time that's him doing all that and
within seconds he has bad news yes why
doesn't maybe someone else is trying to
access república that's right he says
not only is there a virus on my computer
somebody is trying to hack in I'm going
to give up this machine and make the
pickup then you come here hey you bought
the Thunder but remember this computer
is brand new
then comes the sales pitch what does
this cost me to get fixed if people put
a one-year contract it will call you one
hundred ninety nine one nine dollar time
for the big reveal
my name is Jeff Rossen I'm the national
investigative correspondent for NBC News
and this is a brand new computer just
out of the box okay clearly okay I'm not
with it show me the virus where's the
virus I'll tell you the letter you were
trying to sell us a package that our
computer expert says we did not need
it's a brand new computer I'm not trying
to sell any package and providing new
technical assistance just you never let
me show you after several minutes he
still can't show us any virus and then
watch this
he starts surfing the web you're typing
yahoo.com into Google can you let go the
remote connection thank you very much
for your time it doesn't matter whether
you're smart or dumb or you'll old or
young it just is one of those things
where when you're caught off guard
you'll fall for it an urgent warning to
protect you from becoming a victim I've
learned a good lesson next
my gut says what would Jeff Rossen to
run always good advice that these
technicians can be persistent by the way
is Natalie found out but no matter how
official they sound
we contacted Apple and Microsoft both of
them telling NBC news they are not
affiliated with these companies who
create the ads best advice if you get
this pop up on your screen hit escape
and Natalie I know you're in from LA
right now you should hit escape I know
well I tried but it was just they're
frozen and also the way it threatens
that my information could be compromised
that you know I was going to be hacked I
mean that was kind of scary to me I
didn't know I'm not the only one who's
falling forward as you mentioned
hundreds of others and probably
thousands of others including my
father-in-law got the very same thing
and Natalie spent some money on this too
but she had to bring her computer bring
your computer into another person and
spent hundreds of dollars to make sure
the virus wasn't put on it yeah I just I
took it to my computer expert just to
make sure that there was that it hadn't
really been compromised or hacks well
the good news is Jeff you got a new
computer I sure did
I sure did and I'm not giving it back
either haha thanks for being a good
sport now Jeff thank you good lesson
thanks thank you
okay I've got to yeah well I just
wondered okay so in a utility room okay
that's probably the best one yeah it's
the same one you just wrote read out
well I just I've just terrified that boy
it's the same postcode that you just
read well I've got two washing machines
so we haven't identified which one it is
that's covered is it is it is it the
said three one X all right
the newer one the newer one is the z3
one X well up to you I as I say I've got
two washing machines they're both hot
points and so I don't know what other
things did you want me to confirm okay
[Music]
don't know if you remember what number I
just gave him hello that's right yeah I
didn't take what what the name of your
company was I've got to washing machines
they're covered independently show the
newer one is the z3 are x1 3 X 1 if it's
that one well I just took it with the
other ones
mm but it is the other ones a WR
something-something but the said three
are x1 is the is the new one the other
ones just a very old one so I'm assuming
it must be the new market it's only
because
well I was just saying that because we
run a small care office here that we've
got two machines payoff for one which is
the cheapest 199 pounds the whole three
years but I can just let it roll over
them okay what address you sending it to
all right okay
yeah yes hang on I just gotta go and
find it bear with me okay so it's a 8 0
2 3 4 7 8 0 2 3 awesome it's Oh nine one
six one four two one eight zero two
three four sim that's the Royal Bank of
Scotland yeah that's right and the
account number is oh nine okay no
worries just bear with me second
I'm just being called I just I'm just on
the phone
what hang on somebody's falling sorry
hold on I think I'm just gonna go and
see if they're right are you okay
be alright no sorry hang on just sorry
somebody's just fallen I need to go and
sort them out okay Jess bye bye bye
well another another scam call I can't
believe I'm getting all these scam calls
clearly nobody fell down the stairs
clearly I don't have a Hotpoint machine
and clearly the sort code and number I
gave them was completely false so that's
all very interesting and all very scam
herbal
well as her cellphone been ringing
lately from callers you don't recognize
if you're like most people the answer is
yes consumer reporter John Matarese has
the latest on what could be a costly
phone call so you don't waste your money
it's the cell phone scam that won't go
away
back in January people across the
country started receiving strange
hang-up calls on their cell phone well
now these calls have become almost
commonplace but they're still as
dangerous as when they first began it's
the phone scam being heard around the
world in recent days thousands of people
have been reporting strange hang-up
calls mostly to their cell phones really
I don't answer them so I don't know what
they are Kim Mitchell is among many
people getting frustrated by the unknown
calls I did the Do Not Call list and
that only last so long and apparently
it's you know it's over but the Better
Business Bureau says the Do Not Call
list will not stop these calls it's
called the one ring scam your phone will
ring once or twice then stop you'll see
a phone number with an unknown area code
but look closely this call to one of my
family's cell phones was from Antigua in
the Caribbean uses scammers in Antigua
Barbados and other islands are trying to
lure you to return their calls if so a
charge of as much as nineteen dollars
can show up on your monthly bill
according to the BBB simple advice don't
answer your cell phone if you see a call
coming in from an area code you don't
recognize if it's really important such
as a distant relative they will leave
you a voicemail message
that way you don't waste your money I'm
John Matarese
I've been trying to catch the dirtiest scam on video recording ever since it happened to me.
And what happened was that a guy comes behind you and he puts dog [ __ ] down on your shoes.
Also then his friend comes along and offers you to clean off for an insane amount.
And I finally got it on film when I showed my friend around Delhi.
Below here is Palika Bazaar
And behind that is where the guy [ __ ] on your shoes.
Now look at the man in the blue shirt.
He is Mr.  Bæ.
He spotted us and he walks in position behind us and is ready to [ __ ] on my friend.
He's following us now and I'm moving on with my friend
and that's where he bends behind my friend and rests dog bae on his shoes.
Look now Mr.  Bæ runs around the pillar to my friend.
The [ __ ] is wrapped in a newspaper and he rolls it so he can secure it out of the paper just like he is frosting for cake
Karl: Where did it come from?  I do not know.
And now he pretends to be a friendly guy who can help us clean shoes.
Wow.  Thank god he is there to help us.
"His friend in the crime, shoe cleaning man, is just around the corner waiting for us."
Karl: What's the chance?  I just told you this would happen.
so I can not believe what just happened.
I just told my friend that we should go where the guy does [ __ ] on people's shoes here in Delhi.
"And within two seconds, he had [ __ ] on his shoes.  What the hell!"
And it's filmed on camera.  Oh my god
And it happened to me a long time ago right here in this place.
"The first time, he asked me for 2000 rupees."
and then I just cleaned it with a blade myself.
But they asked him for 2500 rupees today.
And he managed to negotiate them down to 900.
And how these scams work is
"... one guy who [ __ ] on the shoe and there another guy who comes and ""helps"" you clean."
"He takes you to a cleaner man, a shoe cleaner here"
and then he helps you negotiate the price down a bit.
so you feel like you're getting a good deal.  As if you have been [ __ ] on but you have been helped by a local at the same time.
"Shut up!  man, I just can not believe this."
But Mr.  Bæ does not stop there.
I spied on him a bit and he strikes again.
This time on a British tourist.
I saw him kneel behind and secure [ __ ] on this guy's shoes.
Is everything OK? 
Tourist: yes everything is fine.
Now I would like to have you protected from Mr. Bæ as well
He is planning here around Palika Bazaar here in Delhi.
And Palika Bazaar instead ... it's just scammers paradise.
"And there's so much police presence, but nothing ever happens to these guys."
And I know some of you guys are getting really angry at what this guy is doing to the guests here.
But I do not want you to do anything.  This is not a witch hunt.
"if you want to do something, share this video with Delhi Police"
it is their job and only their job to enforce the law here and stop this guy.
And if you are foreign tourist coming soon to India
take my quick start security guide on indiasurvivalguide.com
it is going to help you travel safely and securely here in India
because I wanted you to enjoy India as much as I do.
I want you to have an incredible experience here.
a warning from the Justice Department
about a telephone scam targeting local
homeowners where the caller actually
threatens to arrest you if you don't pay
up no call for actions Keith King
reveals how the scam artist operates
Keith yeah good evening guys and a late
the woman has received several messages
several phone calls from someone
claiming to be with the DEA and that he
has a warrant for her arrest federal
authorities say this is all part of an
international extortion scheme Cassy
Woolworth is not in trouble with the law
doesn't even have an outstanding traffic
ticket but she recently got a voicemail
message that grabbed her attention the
caller claimed to be a DEA agent scary
it is scary and he always states the
gentleman on the phone way states that
they're just around the corner the
Justice Department recently released a
public warning about this scam an
international extortion scheme where the
criminal impersonates a DEA agent Waller
says she has gotten four of these calls
in the last six months a man claiming to
be with the Drug Enforcement
Administration accuses they're buying
meds from an online pharmacy based in
the Dominican Republic something she's
never done the scammer ordered
Woolworths to pay a fine it started at
"$7,500 and then dropped to 400 the"
warrant will be satisfied everything
will be okay and they'll be on their way
and they take MasterCard Visa and
American Express for you in one call the
scammer directed her to an address in
the river market which happens to be a
Western Union location where she could
wire money that is ridiculous and I'm
afraid that there are people that are
getting out their debit card are
actually going to 19 third street and
paying for nothing and the Justice
Department says if you get one of these
phone calls refuse the demand and report
the threat for call for action I'm Keith

"Yeah, of course. Erm, hang on, I’ll just get my card."

the calls that annoy nearly every
Canadian with a phone were the subject
"of a police raid today 11,000 kilometers"
from Canada a sweep targeting scammers
that at best steal your time and at
worst take your money a New Delhi police
report declares the arrest of 32
white-collar criminals fraudsters using
illegal techniques who operated at night
which is morning an afternoon in most of
Canada
CTV's Quebec bureau chief Genevieve
Bosch may on the suspects who went after
anyone who answered breaking news in
India today with a Canadian connection
Delhi police cracked down on what they
call a swanky international cheating
they allegedly caught fraudsters in the
act dialing out to Canadian numbers
officers picked up 32 suspects of the
call center seized 55 computers 35 cell
phones and the scripts to be read the
call immediately
this time alleged fraudsters used the
sin scam they mask their phone numbers
to pose as police or government
officials their calls often warned
victims their Social Insurance numbers
were compromised that they needed to
hand over thousands of dollars to avoid
arrest he was just over six thousand
dollars is that correct
Canada's anti-fraud Center says the bus
may dial down the number of scam calls
but only temporarily hundreds of illegal
call centers have popped up in India
this year alone fraudsters learn from
past busts and quickly find new scams to
dupe victims just as we were working on
this story a call from a foreign number
and a quick hang up possibly the now
well-worn one ring scam dial back the
number and incur a connection fee it is
a reminder to look out for a variety of
ruses best practices you know not
trusting call this play with somebody's
calling you you know asking you for
money or demanding money or extorting
money from you to hang out the phone a
police officer in Victoria posted
evidence online anyone can be targeted
fraudsters had left him a message he
called that my name a lot of people are
losing a lot of money because of this
and we take it seriously
daily pool
a Canadian victim who'd been robbed of
"more than $13,000 sparked this latest"
investigation but as long as there's
money to be made State Police there will
be phone scans Lisa at least this one is

[Music]
debater 10 powered by rp sanjeev goenka
group
and berger silk
bofors augusta pilatus
these three names have become synonymous
to ups
corruption and the middlemen in the
deals have
come to symbolize an era of compromise
on defense equipment
tonight 78 ex-servicemen have issued a
statement and their message is clear
there can be no compromise on national
security there can be no compromise in
corruption
here's what they've said in the letter
and then we debate
in december 2018 middlemen christian
michelle was dragged back to india
christian christian have you turned an
approval
christian christian would you give facts
christian
would you give facts christian would you
give facts to india
christian would you tell the truth
agencies had a big catch in hand
23 months later the investigation in the
multi-crore scam has thrown up more
names
the 70 million kickback that was
actually received in agusta westland
scam it was distributed between three
people one is christian michelle
the other is jerosha and the third
person is a man called rajiv saxena who
was basically brought
from dubai and he categorically mentions
kamal nats family member here
here point number five clearly it says
that one million us dollars was received
by ratul puri
from christian michel and then ratul
puri
with more stunning revelations the focus
is back on upa era scams
78 veterans have issued a statement and
the tone antenna of the statement
clearly indicated
that there can be no compromise on
national security
they have written and i quote
this cannot be viewed simply as a matter
of corruption but must be considered in
the wider ambit of anti-national
activities at par with other acts
such as terrorism
congress
tonight the 78 veterans echo nation's
thoughts on corruption in defence
it's national security first there can
be no compromise
let's debate
and joining us on the debate tonight
gopal krishna garwal national
spokesperson of the bjp
lieutenant general vk chaturvedi who's a
defense analyst and a signatory of this
very very hard hitting letter
lieutenant general sanjay kulkarni who's
also a signatory
air marshal s p singh who's also
a signatory to the letter major general
dhruv katoch
director of the india foundation and
also a signatory to the letter
on the other side we have chaitan singh
political analyst and lawyer
said this at the bus political analyst
mana sweetheart
political analyst nishant varma
political analyst
joining us in a short while from now we
will also have those
joining us i'd like to go across to
lieutenant general vk uh
chaturvedhi because never before have we
seen this kind
of a call for action from veterans
today it has been put in black and white
because when we've
spoken about defense deals we've seen
evidence come to the fore
for years and years we've seen the
investigation go on
today there has been a call for action
and if i could quote from the letter
that has been written by 78
veterans it says and i'll just read and
accept
we need to send an unambiguous message
to the high and mighty
that national security is paramount
and anyone trying to play with its
sanctity
will be severely punished left in
general
chaturvedi you said that this just
cannot
defense scams in the context of agusta
cannot be looked at just as an act of
corruption
but as an anti-national act akin to
terrorism
uh that's absolutely correct there has
to be a line drawn
anything that is being done
as regards to the operational
preparedness
combat effectiveness of the armed forces
is definitely uh much beyond corruption
it is an anti-national activity uh
i can use as very strong word it amounts
to prison against the nation
uh it's betrayal of the trust of the
nation that
each citizen of our country has been uh
tasked with has been bestowed with
what has happened uh this is not only
the 78
veterans that have written this it's
many more veterans
it's the voice of the people of india
it's not these
it's the voice of the people of india
will not tolerate
this type of betrayal by anybody
however high or mighty that man may be
maybe and that is the request
to the powers that be that
yes
why shouldn't corruption and this
level of corruption in defense deals
be treated as treason against the nation
as demanded by those who've served the
country
as demanded by veterans from our armed
forces
imaginative being here that why
do we give such powers to a ruling
governing party
to do as they like so what if congress
comes into the power next
and rapid case is open so will modi and
gang
be a part of the treason so therefore we
need to think about it as well
because yes corruption needs to be dealt
with iron hands there are no two ways
about it
but the question is respective parties
in power let's be in indian national
congress or the mahatma party
no party whatsoever has the right to be
corrupt and
take out the coffers of the funds of us
who are taxpaying citizens of this
country
certainly it amounts to corruption yes
but calling it anti-national
cognitive treason only terrorism is
certainly taking it too far
so therefore let me ask the bjp
it we have to rise above politics it is
not
corruption in defense deal is much
different than corruption in normal
issues even during the upa regime this
was accepted that the
corruption what
for 30 years our armed forces were
deprived of
our artillery fighting guns
so same thing happens in these type of
cases
corruption and defense have to be
treated in a separate way
than normal corruption it is a
anti-national activity
by the people
same treatment should come to us raphael
has already been clarified
you know what exactly happened in the
rafale deal what happened in the courts
now one second
chetan one second this is a civil you
know we'll have a civil debate and let
everyone get their chance
he made a couple of points and i want to
go across his signatories it's not a
very you know it's not it's not an issue
where you can just
mudsling on the debate without knowing
the facts of the case right you spoke
about rafal
what if congress comes to power and
rafal has opened up my
my friend abbas you know what happened
in the rafale case
read up on it read up on it on what
happened in the supreme court what
happened in the courts
what happened there were facts that were
put out in the public domain my friend
this debate is not about rafal we've had
enough debates on rafale okay
and you're talking to veterans who know
their facts
one second calm down abbas calm down
calm down come down
let me tell you this now one second you
may not be aware
you may not be aware of some of the
facts but let me educate you and bring
in
bring in at this point air marshal spc i
don't need the bj
marshall sp
it's a close chapter it's a close
chapter that's fine it's a close chapter
but my question was
you know let's stick to the facts
okay okay let me tell you manasvi
before you come in i want to ask the
question to major general dhruv kartos
because you know we've had the
opportunity
at republic and before this you know
arnab's team arnab steve and i'm saying
this with all responsibility right
when a story called arms gate broke we
were in the middle of it
exposing details of what were happening
and i think may general roof cut knows
exactly what i'm talking about
and even before even before the indian
media
and we accessed the details the matter
had reached the courts in italy
there were diaries that were accessed
let me
tell you about a few initials that were
mentioned in these notes that we
you know it's on the back of our heads
you know let me tell you
af 6 million
bur 8.4 million pol
six million ap ap
three million now this was a up era note
and this has been debated widely this is
available on the public domain
and you can read about it general my
point being
it's not as simple as they make it out
to be it's not a case of political
you know it's okay it's easy to say that
you know it's
politics it's a political vision but you
know it and i think veterans know it
best
how deep the rot runs when it comes to
defense scams
right right and then just take about two
ten
dollars take about two minutes to give
my thoughts please one
let us be very clear yeah this is not a
political debate
my our point has been very simple
exception
wherever it exists regardless of the
political party
must be sorted out right so if i'm not
going to going into the decibels of
party a versus party
b that is not of relevance to this issue
now why i will tell you it is relevant
you see we have got a very small defense
budget
and if from that small defense budget if
cheating is going to take place
it becomes even smaller that is point
number one
point number two if you weaken your
security forces
you see what had happened was a people
just prior to this
statement was made that it doesn't
really matter whether it's a defense
scam
or some other scam no it matters you see
your ultimate defense your last line of
defense is your armed forces
when your army loses the nation loses so
let us say you have a scam in the
agriculture ministry
okay we'll sort it out but the nation is
not compromised
you are not conquered by somebody else
you lose your military power
you we will be conquered the way we have
been conquered for the last
1 000 years so let us get this correct
it is important to ensure that this
corruption does not take place
now point number three and i'm very
serious about this
one from the first jeep scandal which
started till date
please name me one bureaucrat or one
politician
who has been held accountable till now
and the question is because there is no
accountability
these things continue to occur we need
to put a stop to it regardless of the
political affiliation
your politics doesn't matter if you can
do it separately on this debate please
keep the politics out
let us just uh stick to the facts this
point happens
point number four just one year
absolutely
which i need to give out yes just one
more point i want to give you see
what happens now sometimes yes yes
yeah excellent equipment being produced
in the country right
now some foreign chap doesn't want it to
be produced here so you bribe people
within the country
and i'm not saying it's politicians it
could be anybody right
and you get that pro you get that
excellent program scattered
so what have you done you have actually
within india you have weakened the
country
your your atman bharat gets a crushing
defeat
and foreigners come in and they there
are huge kickbacks being paid
now unless we get to the root of this
problem
and ensure that we have our defense
budget
which is correctly spent for what it is
required
only then will the nation have that
degree of confidence in its armed forces
and my last point please it is not
political
regardless of the political party
regardless of the individual's stature
regardless of his rank whether he's in
the political hierarchy
or the military or the bureaucracy he
could be the defense secretary it
doesn't matter
yes please take action and make an
example
yesterday
what you've said what you've said is
being
echoed across the country by patriots
because today what are what what has
been sought
accountability what are we talking about
there can be
no compromise when it comes to national
security and when there is corruption
and rot of this level in defense
deals will accountability
ever be fixed because you've made bofors
case and pointed monastery has been
wanting to come in management
look at the statement and answer our
veterans today
they have said and i'm going to quote
from that letter because this letter is
very very important today they say it is
important that an example be made of all
those found guilty
of taking bribes in the augusta wesleyan
case
so that it has both a deterrent effect
as also serve as a precedent for dealing
with similar cases in the future
isn't it time management you tell us
isn't it time for a full and complete
action against
all those involved and embroiled in
corruption in the agusta wesleyan scam
definitely sagarikaji just give me 45
seconds yes
it is not political it is all about
being showing your patriotism right now
so when we talk about corruption in the
agusta westland the only thing what we
come
what what comes in our mind is
corruption and defense is
destroyed there is no doubt about it
definitely there is a destroy which have
happened
but the pointed question would be that
congress for a minute let's understand
congress is the most corrupt party and
the congress party is the party
which has done corruption in the defense
it has been six and a half seven years
precisely that till date the probe
did not conclude any kind of result so
every time bjp starts an investigation
it does not completes an investigation
the owners the company on those people
who are in power be it bjp congress
if there is a corrupt if there is a
corrupt a person if there is a corrupt
party
why don't you put that person behind
each other
accountability you raised that point
about accountability
now is
yes
six years of the bjp in power what has
happened is we go ahead make your point
and then gopal krishna
comes in yeah quickly quickly we have to
go to other guests as well
heklerjee now the simple question to you
is congress is corrupt
let's book congress behind the bars but
what is your investigation are you going
to investigate or are you
going to just come on media houses and
give up headlines
what is the behind story
the point is
has also been brought here we have
established audit trail which links the
front floor from pristine rivers to
tamale companies to from rajin satsana
to kamala to
michel from there to or puri and they
have been arrested investigation
is taking place these kind of uh deals
defense deal where fun takes place at
international levels
are quite difficult legally to prove but
investigation is going on the right
direction
and today is also a question of moral
responsibility of
political political parties with who are
in power if they indulge into corruption
in the international level there is
quite difficult
their leaders
okay you know there are other panelists
as well as we don't jump in again hold
on there are other panelists as well who
haven't spoken and the debate is
veterans versus camps this is
we're trying to keep it as less
political as possible okay come now
bringing in bringing in air marshall sp
singing air marshall spc
uh talking about the scams that we've
seen in the last two to three decades
roughly the augusta westland scam and we
know the kind of alteration that took
place you know
we've tracked the story very closely how
how you know
strings were pulled to change
specifications for big orders
of these choppers israel aerospace
industry mr
mrs mr sam scam
and beaufort scam in fact when republic
tv launched
you know we took up the story of the
beaufort scam and
didn't go too far the tata
truck scam less than seven to eight
years ago we've seen that as well the
cargill for profit scam
and if you go through all of these all
of these uh you know the facts in all of
these cases it's not just corruption
and like you've mentioned in the letter
it's also about
national security it's not just
corruption it's about
national security a marshal singh
yeah so uh
so you know there is a very
simple equation that i will give you and
that is an equation of trust
between the soldier and the people who
protects
ask any indian he will never say
anything that the soldier is not worth
it they have
implicit faith in their capabilities and
their commitment
unfortunately the people who send the
soldier
to war does the soldier have
the same implicit faith in
this equipment that is cured for him
which gets compromised
because of corruption now indian army
armed forces training
is so good that the tilt our reality and
our loyalty
and our commitment to the nation has
never got compromised
but will this last if such can carry on
that's the important point this may
slowly diminish and one day somebody
will cut on
and say why should i go and give my life
if you are not
giving that i need so the nation and the
people who are in governance
need to realize that we have to do
this corruption it's not new it started
in 1948 with the village
and any foreign deal that has happened
especially with the western world
has got somewhere or the other
compromise but when
it's a nation-two nation like for
example
any deal that we have had almost 75 of
our equipment from russia
i don't think anybody has ever heard of
a scam of a
russian purchased equipment because that
was always nation issue nation
a similar thing happened with raphael
recently a lot of
bad blood was thrown a lot of dirty
water flew under the drain but
ultimately the supreme court
ruled that there was no connection
now there may be people's compulsions
to raise charges on each other but don't
forget
that that not only affects the training
preparedness and combat capability of
the armed forces
it has a marked effect on the morale
and that's the key element that makes a
soldier fight
for his nation
yeah i think even nishant will agree
today that irrespective of uh
you know politics on each side there is
a need to fight
corruption and defense scams and ensure
it reaches a logical conclusion nishant
i hope you're on the same side today
yes uh allow me uh a minute's time
see while i welcome this fast track
movement
request by the veterans i salute all of
them
but i need to make two quick points here
number one
yes augusta westland was blacklisted in
2013 by the upa government
and check your facts in 2016 the modi
government reversed
the black listing and it was raised in
the parliament by anan sharma of
congress
that how did that happen number one
number two yes
we need to know the corrupts and we also
need to know why cbi lost the case
in italy on the augusta westland mata
and what happened after that i would
like to quote major general katoch
who absolutely pinpointed said that
there is a chap somewhere in foreign
country
who wishes to sell something to india
and hence our own ahmed bharat goes for
a toss
i must highlight that on 22nd of june
this year
vk saraswat of niti ayoga said we should
stop
procuring we should stop procuring the
raw material of bulletproof jackets
which we procure from china so major
general katowice would you say
that the modi government has a chap
there in china selling
the raw material of bulletproof jackets
to india if that being the case modi
government is equally corrupt
number three very importantly lieutenant
general chaturvedi
sir right in the beginning you said that
your letter is the voice of
this country and nation and people of it
negative sir that is not true
because we have seen that 2g scam coal
scam
and bow force and what not nothing comes
out
i understand your point of view that
while congress is in power probably they
would not
act upon it but what about the other
parties when they are in power
especially the contemporaries of mr modi
and mr modi's party why are they not
able to bring it to a logical
and a legal end now that is the pain
that i and you both suffer
and yes general katoch while you write
for the rss mouthpiece organizer
and you've been criticizing upa i will
take your point
corrupts should be booked could it be
from any party i think this suffices
isn't it niranjan
not required yeah not required i think
absolutely and and
this is the point that mayor general
made when he's got the right to write
anywhere
absolutely and and this is something he
said as a veteran who served the country
he said let's keep this away from
politics because the demand
yes you want to come in because your
demand has been for a focused
investigation
your demand has been for
yeah yes i must put this on record right
i i have spoken in the rajiv gandhi
institute which is a congress think tank
i have spoken there i have written for
that institute also please check yeah
now does that make me a congress agent i
write exactly
i write for various newspapers and
journals so please don't put that
you know what i said right in the
beginning don't get politics into this
please
it is not going to do any good to you or
to anybody else
i am not a critic of the congress or a
supporter of any other party
it doesn't matter to me right i am
simply making a point yeah
if you compromise your defense today you
will compromise it forever
right on on the chinese equipment now
let's make it clear
the mobile phone which i'm using today
has chinese components i can't help it
right and this is not a legacy which i
started yesterday or today it is a very
long term legacy
right i can tell you of the uh the uh
the
iron ore of india of the last 15 years
which has been going to china and coming
back as uh as
a manufactured goods so let us not get
involved into that there have been
certain compulsions
across the years for imports and exports
and i'm not going to get into
each and every detail i am simply
talking about
a very very simple cases of corruption
yes yeah you want to buy a particular
you want to buy a particular piece of
equipment let us say an athletic gun
so people say okay we will give you 50
million dollars please buy a gun
all that i'm saying is don't do that
please that is anti-national
right now if you find any problem with
that yes
very important point made also left in
general sanjay kulkarni also want
wants to come in and i'm very sorry to
interrupt you there but uh lieutenant
general sanjay kulkarni hasn't spoken
and he wants to come in here as he makes
this
similar point he's also a signatory to
the statement
we've seen what has led to let's put the
facts on record today
we've seen what has led to this kind of
a statement because for years
we've heard about the scams we've seen
the proof
we've we've heard debates on it we've
seen parliament pick it up
but now it's come the time has come when
veterans have come out and have said
that enough
we need accountability an example has to
be set
what has just happened and left in
general sanjay kulkarni
correct me if i'm wrong today when there
is a statement that you've quoted in the
letter that all of you have been
signatory to which is the statement
of rajiv saksena where there are
names of former madhya pradesh chief
ministers nephew ratalpuri
his sons and the kind of
allegation that has been made today when
you write a statement like this
what goes on in your mind
see what happens is that corruption
unfortunately
in our country seems to have run across
all
to name it in a specific department it
would be wrong it's across the board
you see the transparency international
where almost even
though in 2019 they've said that
corruption level from 56 percent it has
come down to 51
that means 51 percent in india are
preferring to give bribes and accept
pride it hasn't made any difference
whatsoever
you realize it but yes it depends there
should be zero tolerance for corruption
number one
number two it affects your procurement
number three it affects your transfer of
technologies
number four people become ex you know
rather
uh hesitant to sign on files fearing
that there would be a probe and so it
carries on
you find that modernization is badly
affected whenever you are trying to
import things they are very expensive it
affects indigenization
even if it is helping indigenization at
some point of time you find that
some kind of a thing will further delay
and then capacity building takes time
intentions can change overnight you see
what's happening now in china so
capacity building takes time and if
corruption
is preventing procurement if corruption
is preventing indigenization
if corruption is delaying modernization
all of it affects the modernization
of the armed forces we have to keep pace
with it and therefore whatever be it so
if anybody has found crap i think it
should be time-bound investigation
people should be brought to book example
should be made of them
therefore a deterrence is there that
should be found corrupt you will be
punished
and that itself should be just not
indefinitely i think it should be across
the board
otherwise what would happen it is
nothing to do with politics it runs in
our blood
now if you are it's unfortunate that if
it runs in our blood then we
must be very very careful if some
countries like singapore
which is supposed to be the most corrupt
have become such big huge countries
in such a small thing like delhi also
why can't we
we are such a lovely people such good
nature
we've got all the resources we've got
all the brains we've got all the money
everything forget about politics forget
about which party is in power
yeah but the very fact that corruption
is a big
vein corruption must be eradicated there
must
across the party everybody must say
corruption
zero tolerance punishment definite can i
ask a simple
question to any of the signatories
please yeah
i just want to make a short intervention
and then i'll go across the torsi who
hasn't spoken and then i'll go across to
chaitanya as well i just want to make a
small point because nishant mentioned
something i don't want to draw nishant
in because those
and chaitan haven't spoken but he spoke
about china and
and and the raw material with china it
just struck me right
it just struck me you remember the
height of doklam
there was a leader a political family
dining with the chinese in the height of
doklam
you remember that and you were talking
about booking people
because we're on we're on a point of
politics and thousands coming in i want
him
i want to hear from tausifer whether
or whether my question is whether you
remember all of palmei
we broke this when when we when we
started republic tv we opened up the
bofors files
one of palmy was having plane rides with
a particular
leader from a particular party from a
pr with a prime minister joseph i don't
know whether you know about this but all
of palmy
was having plane rides with and
allegedly plotting bofors
on plane rides with a political family
okay
shouldn't he have been booked i'm just
asking you a question
whether those who signed off on changes
for the augusta the choppers the 12
choppers there
you know the levels were changed you
know everything was changed in the last
minute to suit political
kickbacks shouldn't they be booked
third were the names of those
handwritten people which was also
documented in italian quotes
copies of which are available even on
google and on the italian prosecution
website
shouldn't those people be booked to see
if
and i want you to be honest whoever's
corrupt please call out corruption
right every ever profit
in defense scams is the biggest crime
of course strict action should be taken
against everyone involved in a defensive
scam it was very painful
you know for for people of my generation
to grow up watching and hearing on tv
day and night about the the
uh scam during the nba government
of copying scam right after the cargill
war
this coffin scam won earth on earth you
see
today we we have the news that uh one
conviction has taken place
of uh miss jaitley uh who has been
sentenced to four years jail
in a 2001 case of uh
corruption in defense deal now we also
know that the file
deal scam was allegation was made but
what happened
in that case in the central government
lawyer in the supreme court
of india submit that we have lost the
file
of the rafale case and where is our
national security what kind of a
statement is this
was this not an attempt to evade
investigation
to to instead of coming openly to allow
the the investigation in the final
allegation the government was seen
trying
and instead said that the file
had been stolen what kind of defense
irresponsible people are running the
defense ministry who comes and
makes this submission in the court you
know
when we talk about defense deal i'm sure
every
every people across the board well
i i was hoping you'll make an
observation on the case in case in hand
i was hoping dorsey if you would make an
observation about the case in hand being
the augusta case which is
immediately under the spotlight and
facts are emerging
okay caitanya hasn't spoken you have a
point to make do you back the veterans
when they say that
clean up corruption and defense scams
yes it's akin to terrorism almost
correct so see correct no no they are
absolutely
right and i salute you for this such a
strong words
action which they want to be taken on
the people
specifically who are involved in the
corruption of defense team
you see around the globe the defense
deal corruption is a matter of a serious
concern around the globe and
specifically
the democracies we know what is
happening now what we gonna talk about
here
look the veterans can certainly raise
their voice and they can pressurize
government to take a strong steps in
terms of coming up with the corruption
law
see these kind of laws you know when
these laws are going to come up
they would be specifically dealing you
see like government comes of a different
kind of law you see like love jihad
there's one thing you know
they're just talking about it why not
this is the most sensitive subject
matter
so why not to come up with a lot with
the law which is certainly going to be
deal
with regards to the defense deals second
most important point
as kulkarni saab has mentioned see
when it comes down to defense deal if
the amount has been
used by some people for their own
interest
it's a matter of serious concern every
individual in this
country is going to get affected because
it's a matter of a
nation security and of the nation
interest so now what can be done
is the point and who can do it we know
gopal subramanyam is sitting out here
but what he is doing
rather than behaving and acting like a
mature
person of a current dispensation he is
blaming the opposition
what is the point of going backward we
have to move forward
they were on the border they have seen
what kind of challenges
their people their young men their brave
hearts
when they are fighting let me let me end
by the defense
because i'm running out of time and you
made some fantastic arguments talking
about
talking about corruption at large and
someone mentioned uh
you know the the coffin scam and spoke
about
how yeah i want to make one last point
because i've completely run out of time
this is a subject that we can look at in
greater detail in the days to come
but i just want to make one point have
you heard of the cargill for profit scam
cargill for profit scam let me tell you
in a nutshell everyone who spoke about
every other scam and how politicians and
bureaucrats have you
do you know about the kargil for profit
scam how in the name of
army and the armed forces politicians
and bureaucrats
stole properties from
forces do you know about that
just think about that and think of all
the arguments that you made
while while questioning the veterans on
this debate
while questioning the veterans on this
debate and what they seek is
accountability when we talk about each
of this camp
accountability still hasn't been fixed
on those
responsible and only because of the want
of time we'll have to thank thank
all our panelists for joining us on this
debate
we'd like to thank you for running yes
we're running out of time but like
niranjan said we will look at this into
greater detail
yeah look at this in greater detail but
thank you for joining us thank you
"-Afiq! Over here.
 -Tiger!"
#NAME?
"Have you considered
 what I told you?"
#NAME?
No.
"All I have to do is to go to Singapore
 and open a bank account?"
Yes. It's easy money.
"Here's $1,050 to deposit
 into the account."
"You can use $50 to buy a
 Singapore SIM card."
"The remainder is for your
 personal expenses."
Thank you!
Anything else?
"Of course, there is more."
"You will receive
 $2,000 Singapore dollars for this job."
"$2,000 Singapore dollars?"
Just to open the account?
"Open the account
 and make some withdrawals later."
"You will hand me the money
 that you have withdrawn."
"You will open an account
 at this Singapore bank."
I will see you tomorrow.
"Bring along the ATM card
 and other bank documents."
Just to make sure everything is in order.
Okay.
Hi.
"I want to buy a SIM card that has data,"
"so that I can send
 text messages to others."
"Don't worry,
 nowadays all SIM cards includes data."
I need your IC.
"-I'm Malaysian. Is my passport, okay?
 -Okay."
This is a $15 SIM card.
"Hi, sir. Can I help you?"
"Yes, I would like to open
 a savings account"
"-and deposit $1,000 into it.
 -Okay, please wait for a while."
"Sir, this is your ATM card,
 your passbook,"
ibanking username and PIN.
"The $1,000 has been deposited
 into your savings account."
"You can change
 the PIN at any ATM."
Thank you.
Afiq.
"You had no problems
 opening the bank account, right?"
No. There were no problems at all.
"Here are the banking details
 and the ATM card."
Everything looks in order.
"-Okay, that's it.
 -That's it?"
You hold on to this.
"For now, you just get home
 and wait for my call."
Okay.
Hello.
You are required to bring your IC
"and go down to the nearest police station
 as you have a police case pending."
"If you need any clarification,
 please press zero."
"Hi, Inspector Lim from the
 Singapore Police Force."
"Can I have your name
 and IC number, please?"
My name is Li Xi Ying
and my IC number is S89140279H.
"Okay, please hold on."
"Yes, Miss Li. It appears that there is a
 pending case against you in China."
The case number is A459678.
"As this is a case originating from China,"
"I will have to connect you to an officer
 from the China Police Force."
Please hold.
Hello.
We're home.
What's wrong?
"I just got a call from the China Police,"
"saying that I am under investigation
 for international money laundering."
"It's a scam.
 Just ignore the person who called."
"But the caller ID showed the
 China Police emergency number."
It's called spoofing.
Scammers use such spoofing technology
"to make a fake caller ID
 appear on your phone."
"But they said they
 needed to access my bank account"
"to see if there are any
 large unexplained transactions."
"Don't tell me you gave them
 your user ID and PIN?"
They had a warrant of arrest for me!
"They said they were going to
 extradite me back to China!"
"They also said they would
 withdraw the arrest warrant"
"and close the case
 if they could just examine my account."
Then your money is probably gone!
Call the bank now.
"We need to make a
 police report immediately."
The scammers first tricked the victim
"into believing that they were officers
 from the Singapore and China Police Force."
"They said if I didn't do as they instructed,"
"they would get the Singapore Police
 to arrest me and send me back to China."
"I have a one-year-old baby
 and I can't leave her."
"I just wanted them to finish their investigation
 and close the case,"
so I did whatever they asked.
I understand.
Do you have your bank account number?
This is the bank and my account number.
"Did you check
 your account after the call?"
Yes. All my money is gone!
"-How much?
 -$19,900."
"Call the victim's bank and see
 where the money was transferred to."
"If it was transferred to another local bank,"
have the other bank freeze the account
"and obtain the
 bank account holder's details."
"Ask the bank to flag it and
 report any activity from the account."
"You are required to bring your IC
 and go down to the nearest police station..."
Please press zero.
"Hi, Inspector Lim from the
 Singapore Police Force."
"It appears that there is a
 pending police case against you in China."
"I am going to connect you with an officer
 from the China Police Force."
"According to the victim's bank,"
"Miss Li's money was transferred to
 an account at Orient Global Bank"
"which is registered to a Malaysian,
 Mohamad Afiq."
When was Afiq's account opened?
"About four days ago,
 at the Balestier branch."
"How much money is
 there in Afiq's account?"
"According to the bank,
 there has already been two deposits."
"The first deposit was a total of $19,900"
from our victim yesterday.
"The second amount was $26,000,"
"which was transferred into
 Afiq's account about an hour ago."
"If my suspicions are correct, the $26,000
 belongs to a second scam victim."
"The account was open
 just four days ago"
and there's already two big deposits.
"Let's stop this scam
 before it claims more victims."
Jimmy.
I just interviewed Mr Zhen.
And he told me that he was scammed
"by an Inspector Meng Jie
 from the China Police Force."
"The scammer used the same
 modus operandi as with the first victim"
"and Mr Zhen's $26,000
 was transferred out of his account."
"I just checked with the bank
 and they confirmed it."
I've made an official inquiry with ICA.
"It has been confirmed that Mohamad Afiq
 entered Singapore on 22nd July."
"On the same day,"
"he opened a bank account with
 Orient Global Bank's Balestier branch."
He left Singapore later that day.
"There is a high possibility that
 Afiq will be entering Singapore again"
to make a withdrawal soon.
I have alerted ICA
"to monitor and inform us
 the moment he enters Singapore."
"And the bank will alert us
 if there is any activity."
"Yes, so now, we wait for him
 to make his move."
Hello?
Go to Singapore immediately.
"Bring your ATM card
 and all the bank documents with you."
"I will text you the amount
 to withdraw later."
Jimmy.
That was ICA.
Afiq has just cleared immigration.
Okay. We need to catch him in the act.
Call Orient Global Bank to alert them.
"Ask them to inform us the moment
 Afiq shows up at any of their branches."
"Withdraw only $12,600?"
Why not all?
"Hi, I would like to make a withdrawal."
Can I have some identification?
Is there a problem?
"No, sir. It's a large amount."
"I need to get approval from my manager.
 Please hold."
"Mr Zaid, we have a customer who wants to
 withdraw $12,600 from his account."
"However, his account has
 been red-flagged."
"-What's the customer's name?
 -Mohamad Afiq."
Jimmy. It's Orient Global Bank.
"Afiq is at Balestier branch now,
 trying to withdraw $12,600."
"Okay, ask them to delay him."
We'll be there in 15 minutes. Let's go!
"Miss, may I know why
 it's taking so long?"
"Mr Afiq, I'm Mohd Zaid,
 the Branch Manager."
"So sorry to keep you waiting.
 Could you please come with us?"
#NAME?
Don't worry. We are still checking.
"We thought you might be
 more comfortable waiting in a room."
This way please.
We'll settle this as quickly as we can.
"Mr Afiq, please help yourself
 to the drink while waiting."
"I don't want any drinks.
 I need to leave."
"-I'll come back later.
 -Sir...Mr Afiq."
Mohamad Afiq.
"I am Senior Investigation Officer,
 Jimmy Tan from CID."
"I'm placing you under arrest
 for your involvement in"
"dishonestly receiving
 stolen property."
"Your phone was sent to
 our Forensic Department"
and these messages were retrieved.
Can you explain this?
"There have been
 two reports of cheating."
"The victims lost a total of $45,900."
"Coincidently, this is exactly
 the same amount in your bank account."
"All the money that was transferred
 to your account, was obtained illegally."
"So tell me, Afiq,"
"are you responsible
 for cheating them of their money?"
What?
No!
"Tiger passed me some money,"
"asked me to come to Singapore
 and open a bank account."
What else were you supposed to do?
"I was supposed to withdraw money
 from the bank and return to JB."
"That's all, I swear!"
#NAME?
"Mohamad Afiq Bin Ishak
 was sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment"
"for assisting another person
 to retain criminal proceeds."
"Fortunately, for the victims
 in the case you have just seen,"
they managed to get their money back.
"Usually in such cases,"
"the victims' money is rarely,
 if ever, recovered."
"There have also been several reports
 where scammers had impersonated an officer"
"from the Singapore Police Force,"
and direct victims to a fake SPF website.
"The victims were then asked to
 follow the instructions"
to provide confidential information
"such as credit card details
 and internet banking credentials,"
purportedly for investigation purposes.
"However, it is actually
 a phishing site in disguise,"
"designed to extract
 useful personal information"
"and privileged banking details
 of unsuspecting victims,"
"resulting in extensive monetary
 losses in most reported cases."
"The Police would like to clarify
 that the official SPF website is"

"Until next time,"
"stay alert,"

and stay strong.
today I will be showing you how to block
scam callers on your metro pcs phone so
stay tuned guys so the first step you're
going to go ahead and want to perform is
go to phone and go to the Dollar pad so
there's going to be three codes that you
guys can put into the dialer pad there's
going to be an enable for scam blocking
a disabled for scam blocking and a
checker to see if your scam blocking is
on or not
so the first code we're going to go
ahead and put in is the enabler for scam
blocking so this is a pretty simple code
we're going to go ahead and put pound 6
6 to pound and then dial and it's going
to go ahead and say us SD code is
running now it says your request to
enable scam blocking is being processed
please wait a few minutes for scam
blocking to begin to disable you can
dial pound 6 3 to pound ok guys so this
is the other code you guys can go ahead
and use if you would like to disable
scam blocking but I don't see why
there's any reason to disable it I would
really recommend to have this on it is
an awesome feature that MetroPCS has
given us and I think we should take
advantage ok guys so the last code I'm
going to go ahead and perform for you
guys here is to check if your scam block
is enabled or disabled so now to go
ahead and check if your scam block is
enabled or disabled all you're going to
want to do is press pound seven eight
seven pound and then you're going to go
ahead and call out it says us SD code is
running scam blocking is currently
enabled to disable dial pound six three
two so we did this right and it
definitely works pretty nicely but now I
want to go into why you should have scam
block enabled okay guys the reason why
you should have scam blocking enabled is
in 2017 these new solicitors have
released kind of a new kind of way to
get your authorization to do certain
things to send you certain emails and
stuff now they're going to go ahead and
check all these phone numbers in
every day I'm sure you've received these
calls frequently if not you've received
them before but if you guys have been
receiving these in 2017 all they need
you to say on the line is yes so all
they need is your voice confirmation of
yes now how they do this is they call
you and you answer the phone and they
say hi is this blah blah blah if you say
yes then they have confirmation to do
whatever they please with your with your
phone numbers so that is a reason why
scam blocking is a really good feature
and I'm really happy that MetroPCS has
added this to all of their phone lines
but yeah that is pretty awesome also
there's other things that go into it now
this scam blocking and when it's enabled
should terminate the call when they're
trying to call you so if they're trying
to call you
it should terminate it for you guys you
guys for watching I really do appreciate
"it now I'm almost at 6,000 subscribers"

description down below I will leave all
the codes because I know a lot of you
aren't good with memory so am I so I
have that problem as well so some of you
might not be good with memory so I'll

[Music]
awareness on phishing emails calls or
SMS you might have experienced a
fraudster reaching you through calls SMS
or email communicating that you have won
a significant amount of money through a
raffle or lottery price normally
Durham's
200k up to 2 M they will identify
themselves with popular company or brand
names like Etisalat or Expo - o - o
among others and request an upfront
Commission government taxes or bank fees
to be paid the amount that they can
request can go from a few thousands of
Durham's to hundred thousand or more to
be transferred to several Etisalat
numbers how usually you get reluctant to
pay the amount upfront but the argument
is that government taxes or fees must be
paid before the transfer of the prize
furthermore to prove that they are
Etisalat they might do the following one
send a token number through Etisalat INF
which will be sent by registering your
number in Etisalat online services also
many times the Etisalat INF sender is
fake to ask you to validate if the SIM
card printed number starts with 8 9 9 7
1 all sims in UAE have that starting
sequence 3 send an email with the
confirmation of the price and even
present a scan to check with the amount
following this you might be convinced of
the authenticity of the call so they
will instruct you to pay the amount by
using one of the below channels Etisalat
payment machines most common
a voucher scratchcards online portals
into several Etisalat numbers when you
recharge the money the fraudsters will
transfer and sell the balance
immediately usually they are very fast
and you will lose all your money within
minutes please beware of those scammers
do not entertain or respond to them do
not disclose confidential information
and especially don't transfer any amount
Hetty salat is not involved in this kind
of raffle of prizes report all cases to
Etisalat customer care number at 101 if
you are scammed make sure you report to
the police also spread the word to
everyone you know so that no one becomes
a victim of these scams
recently one of you sent me an email
your family members had received where
scammers were claiming to be from paypal
and they noticed some strange behavior
on your account these scammers then
connected your computer and claimed that
hackers from the dark
web have stolen your identity and as
you'll see in the video
it's a way for them to trick their
victims into buying
gift cards but what if we gave them a
taste of their own medicine what if at
the very end when they're expecting gift
cards
a dark web hacker came in and stole them
so i coded this fake ransomware
virus and uh well you'll see what
happens
okay william i believe that this must be
done by some hackers or someone because
uh if you have an authorized this uh
someone
might have purchased something on the
dark web under your details or your
information you know
oh my
right yeah so what we can do is we can
help you to
update the security on your system and
so that you can and also help you to
fill up the cancellation form so that
it doesn't get auto renewed under your
name
and you'll be not be liable for any kind
of paving future
and if there is any deduction from your
account we can also help you to dispute
that
so you can get the refund of your money
okay can you explain the dark web
okay what i'm saying is it seems like
somebody might have
tried to pursue something on the dark
web like cryptocurrency
which is illegal and used for uh you
know buying ammunition or drugs
things like those oh my god so i think
my grandson has
some of that yeah you know sorry i got
caught up on the bitcoin thing because i
think my grandson has
some of that right but if this is a
fraudulent order i don't
i don't want it you know i i want to
cancel this membership
i mean right we have nothing to do with
what was birthday is bitcoin or
cryptocurrency we have nothing to do
with that
we are just concerned about the renewal
which is going to happen in your account
and there is
a deduction for the next amount of
renewal
so would you like to cancel back and get
your money back
yeah if there's any way to make it so my
computer isn't on the dark web
tool i don't know if you can turn a
light switch
is it illegal to go on the dark web or
just illegal to buy things on it like
can you shop around
like if i just wanted to look no you
know look but don't touch
kind of thing look i'm not sure about
that yeah i'm not sure about that
just window shopping okay well we'll
have to find we'll have to find
it i haven't been there so i cannot tell
you
how how it works okay
or i could wear sunglasses well like
that wouldn't work
no okay do you have a black box open
there
yeah yeah i do yeah
now in the black box gordon's scoring
type neck
attack which is end for november e4 echo
t is in tango s for sugar t
as in tango a for alpha t as in tango
and press enter okay
it says active connections
and it's listing a bunch of them
this is fake by the way do you see any
foreign
foreign address and then established
you see foreign address it's pretending
to terminate
right like the foreign so it seems like
uh there are multiple
ip address from multiple iep address
they were trying to hack into your
computer
as you can see yourself these were some
foreign
uh ip addresses okay so this is the dark
web then this
this is on your computer which i'm
showing you
that if your computer shows that what
are the ip addresses
lastly uh wanted to get into your
computer
so what i can do is i can help you
cancel out this one quickly over here
and get the security update before there
is any more damage made
yeah that seems like a good idea
yeah you know if i remember right i
think i
saw in 60 minutes that the dark web is a
pathway to many abilities that some
consider to be unnatural
i wouldn't want that for my grandson so
maybe maybe you can help me with that
later we'll have to talk about that
i mean is this really that bad is it
really this
illegal or is it just to keep the kids
from
exploring the dark web like you know you
know what i'm saying
like do we just tell stories about it
these hackers are getting more smart and
they are trying to use
uh other person's identity to in order
to purchase the dark web
so if anything goes wrong in future your
name will be coming into it mr william
all right because they have used your
identity
in order to make this payment correct
what if we get what if i
assumed another identity like well i had
a friend who used
he he's from my house absolutely sir
we will go ahead and do that for you can
i just
like worst case scenario is that illegal
that would be
uh that would be illegal sir because
you're also the person who is using
you know your friend's identity why did
i spend an
hour with you on the phone because
your internet was not working and i was
trying to help you with you
right i mean you sent me an email why
didn't you put this in there it's not
possible that we can send you an email
the cancellation
i'm also waiting for you so that we can
fix this up
this logo it's absurd
i'm
yes so you have to go ahead and write
down and fill the form it will not be
filled automatically
mr william why am i filling this form
out
because your information has been hacked
by those hackers and they are trying
to make this purchase okay so once i
fill all this
out i get my money then
correct like in which bank you want your
money back
uh america
sorry america
i wrote it down america which bank is it
bank of america
oh okay got it
what else would it be okay all right not
a problem just simply go ahead and log
into your bank mr william and check
have you received the money or not oh it
says that all the legal documents will
be sent to my email address so
i'll i think we're done
if i understand correctly so thank you
i will not go ahead and log into your
bank right
what
so you will not go ahead and log into
your bank that is what you are telling
me
why would i log into my bank
right now in order to check whether you
have received the money or not right now
uh i guess i can do that hold on sorry i
turned my computer off but i go
okay i think he's getting like really
upset with me that
i didn't follow his instructions
very specifically
sorry you know what you don't need to
tell me sorry okay
you just do the work well i just feel
bad that
i i didn't real i didn't realize no need
to tell me sorry
okay i'm not sorry
i'm not sorry but we just had a word
with my billing team over here okay
and you just do one thing sir just
minimize the page just minimize your
bank page
minimize it i suppose i should explain a
couple things here this is not actually
bank of america
in the beginning of 2021 i had this idea
to spoof
their online bank demo so that it would
look
real on my computer uh instead of using
a fake bank account like i used to
so i suppose this is fake but i control
everything on it and the scammers don't
really have a way of knowing
that this isn't my real bank account my
screen is blank
because the do you want me to restart it
yes sir as the securities
no as the securities are getting updated
that's why the reason you can see a
black tree it's like
he's shouldn't worry about that he's
suspicious
again again are you you are you're
ruining my scam
aren't you your internet is working
really very slow
sir like once again did you switch off
your computer
no sir i don't i don't i'm sure
i don't know what to tell you do one
thing sir
um can you please jimmy uh you know go
ahead and help me with your debit card
number
from bank of america so that i can send
you the money in your debit card
no because i can see another way all
right
remember when i filled out the form when
i filled out the form it just was gonna
send it to my checking account so
can you just like how would you send the
money to somebody who didn't have bank
of america
right all right how would you do that
you don't have a bank of america no i do
i'm asking you the question this is a
hypothetical question so it's kind of
big brain
stuff we're dealing with here i know
that's difficult at times but
hypothetically if i was if i had money
is coming up from your checking account
which is ending with five
eight one one all right i know i know
but you said that because i had bank of
america you'll try using
zalay but what if i didn't have bank of
america
like what if i had chase how would you
send the money
a wire transfer then the case also has
okay what if i was using something that
didn't have
an application like that there's no
rule that says you can't wire transfer
somebody
money i mean when did that rule get
invented
all right sir i'm doing that okay i'm
doing that for you
all right so just give me a moment okay
so this is the typical
refund scam since he can't do zell and
stuff
he's going to edit the html of my bank
account to make it look as though he
gave me too much money
this is it ladies and gentlemen this is
the big moment
announcement everything is figured out
sir you just kindly go
ahead and log into your computer okay
okay so you got the money sent
over to me then i think he just wants me
to notice sister like are you logged
into your computer
yeah i just logged in here i can see my
checking account
so did you
uh which account did you send the money
to
let me confirm just wait okay
i don't know if he wants me to notice or
what's happening
but it very clearly says
robin smith whoever that is
apparently i sent
five thousand dollars to them but my
balance
is more money like and if yeah if i
refresh the page it'll go away
but like yeah wrong date
this guy really goofed up i mean he
really messed up this part of the scam
all right mr william so we have sent you
the money in your checking account which
is ending with five eight one one
okay all right and by mistake
it has been made five thousand right
that's a huge mistake which has been
done due to the
technical issue this is a technical
glitch on my server okay
so you're going to have to back up their
homes
oh my god you can see the money in your
account hold on what are you talking
about
sure just check your checking account is
there 13
000 in your checking account um hold on
let me see
uh no it looks like there's 8976.43
in there right now
all right so in order to receive the
money and in order to provide
the recent money so like in order to
like rectify these errors we have to go
ahead
and you know bring the rectification
card
so like will you be able to do that mr
william
what are we wrecked what do we got to
rectify like
in order to receive the money and in
order to provide like remove these
hackers
we need to go ahead and get the rectify
error cards
so that we can send the money and we can
go ahead and redeem the card for you mr
william
all right i'm saying i don't mind
the process what are we rectificating i
guess
uh like we are rectificating the error
which has been made
all right as you are not be able to
receive the money and as your
information is got hacked
so that's why we are just rectifying all
these things
what is he talking about
i think this is him so we can just do it
one way which is the last way
to figure out how to do this exactly
with your refund amount is 500
so you just need to get two cards for
five hundred dollars all right
can you walk me through why i need to
purchase cards
because sir like so that we can send you
the money in those gift cards
and we can go ahead and you know you can
just redeem the money for you
all right so can you please help me with
stories
like any grocery store is near to you
there's a piggly wiggly down the street
yeah you're just asking me to to get
wrecked right
wreck the rectification instead of me
having to get wrecked can you get
wrecked
for the cards
oh i understand you're gonna give me
your you're gonna give me like cash or
something
do i go to like an atm and take cash out
and buy the gift cards that way
no first you have to spend your money
first you have to make a payment of
thousand dollar
okay okay or
else i will go ahead and once you go
ahead and come out of the store with
those cards
i am going to confirm the card and send
you the money in those cards
like in gift so that then later on i'll
go ahead
and guide you how you can redeem the
card and
make it in a cash all right
so all total you will be receiving from
our company
is fifteen hundred dollar the thousand
dollar which you are spending
and the five hundred dollar which you
owe from our company
all right so all total we will send you
fifteen hundred dollar
so it will be a denomination of 750 and
750
in two cards all right
i i don't understand i don't you're
saying
i go to the store and i purchase
1 000 with my own money
and then it's gonna have
fifteen hundred dollars on it later
like an investment yes because
yes because we will send you the money
on that gift card like a gift
so that he can make it as a card
to get the cash yeah i will let you know
that how you can redeem the card
okay all right so i buy the card or else
you can also do one thing
[Music]
to get out okay now that makes sense
correct
and now can you please tell me yes so
now can you please tell me like where is
the store like what store is near to you
hold on let me just right there so
purchase so can you please tell me are
you ready to leave your home
well it depends on you know the consist
consistency of
my bowel movement
you know what i'm you know what i'm
saying
i've been constipated lately i've been
pretty
blocked up lately something let me let
me say this
because i feel like i can trust you i
have to go to the bathroom
and there's a solid chance
that it'll take me 20 minutes do my own
rectification if you know what i mean
well you can do that so once you're in
your car you just give me a call back
i'll be waiting for your call mr william
okay

trafficking and money laundering here is
a case of just under your name so we
need the drug trafficking and the money
of money laundering right now there's
the case which is down there and there's
warrants number I can see yes you have
the warrants numbers down so yes see so
you're saying that you have never you
are not doing this thing we have never
been you state of Texas yes you taught
me that something in this wisdom crisis
I'm trying to say that someone we
business possibly wanted to use your
personal income to watch these
activities so so are you willing to
cooperate with us or not to find out the
real public who has stolen your identity
I am doing this type of all activities
and able yes so
just don't be cancer
okay okay
trust me canceling your arrest warrant
is not an easy task we have to suspend
your social right away from your name
and we're ready issue a news of you on
your way so in future we're going to use
weapon Allah the new soldier and the
names because why was this finding that
also shocked because there's a large
things going on there so we need to
suspend them and we're going a lot a new
social security number and your name so
that you will never face this explain it
again okay so now in order to take a new
social security I need to clear the
names of this kind of things right now
hi folks well a couple of days ago I had
a phone call from a scammer claiming to
be from Windows to unlock a problem in
my PC that they detected I'll leave a
link up here for you to so you can go to
that first video now again I've had 10
phone call again today from someone
purporting to be from Microsoft again
now at this time I've given them a bit
of the runaround now the reason why I've
done that is although I'm on the thing
in the UK called the TPS register which
means that you can actually report
companies for giving you cold calls or
spam calls or whatever you want to call
them when the calls come from outside
the UK you've got really no control or
regulation over them whatsoever the most
I can do in this situation is to one
bring it to people's attention again and
hoping that with all the other people
who do this sort of thing that the main
bodies who have control over these
companies can actually then penalize
them listen right toward the end because
the actual conversation turns from one
of wanting to help me so this person is
supposed to be doing and we're not
Winship when when I'll play about of him
a little bit later on in the
conversation he actually threatens to
block my computer and then I also have a
laugh and a joke we've forgot that he's
expence mind you you ask yourself the
question is this a reputable company
well no course it isn't a reputable
company you're not dealing with
Microsoft even though he's telling me
that it is he's also telling me that
he's seen my computer inside and he's
seeing viruses and stuff and basically
all he's trying to do is to get me to
click on some automated software that
will make him take over control of my PC
and he will try and get me or say
anything to get me to do that so watch
it until at the end and then you'll see
me have a little bit of a play with him
and he ends up hanging up on me this
time so there you go but it took him 39
minutes - for him to come to that
conclusion though that's 39 minutes of a
company who are phoning from I think
it's India the call center is coming
from India even though he's telling me
that east from Oxfordshire in the UK
which he's not it's just quoting names
of Microsoft in the UK that's all he's
doing then the other one did that as
well anyway have a listen to this and
tell me what you think about
in your comments below if you've had
similar experiences again try and put
details or bring it to the attention by
leaving a comment below because at least
if we can get these videos seen by the
right people who might have control over
this company then there might be a way
of us stopping them from doing it if
they can get of your name as well okay
enjoy this video hello okay
well my computers actually send you a
messages it in told you this my computer
you've seen that I've got a virus on my
computer
oh okay Oh cuz you're from Microsoft oh
I got you right I understand sorry yeah

computers send them anonymous messages
to Microsoft that may and they you've
picked up a virus is that right C is s
OC there's a number side again yeah yeah

Microsoft I've got I've got I've got
McAfee Internet

"So I'm doing a new podcast
called The JackPod,"
"which by the way you can
download it now, it's brand new."
"While I was doing my new
episode, keep in mind"
"that I'm on, like, everybody's
telemarketing list to call."
"So I get calls all day
long, sales calls, whatever,"
"they claim they're the
IRS, they try to scam you"
into going down to a store and buying
the store's gift cards.
"In this case it was Target
gift cards, $1500 worth,"
"scratch off the back,
give them the numbers,"
"and you pay the IRS and
then you're free and clear."
"And you do this to avoid
having a police officer"
"from your local police
department come to your door"
"and arrest you for supposedly
being in debt to the IRS."
"But I promise you, the IRS does not want"
to be paid with Target gift cards.
"I know it's a hard one to
figure out, but they don't."
- [Male] Mr. Lilly?
#NAME?
All right.
- [Male] So I just go ahead and read out
the legal charges against your name ...
- I don't know.
"- [Male] But before I can
proceed I'd like to notify you"
"that the lines on which we
are talking right now are"
recorded by the federal court house.
#NAME?
"- [Male] So I appreciate you,
if you do not interrupt me"
"in between while I'm speaking
and that's my promise"
"to you that I'll give you
fair chance to speak, but once"
"I finish, all right?"
"- All right, that'll be fine."
Fair enough.
"- [Male] As for the documents,
we have identified and"
"audited on your taxes, and
we found that there is some"
"miscalculation error on
the taxes that you filed."
"Doesn't amount the taxes
that we have, the amount that"
"we have is still outstanding
on your name that"
you have not paid the taxes.
"For that reason, the local
authorities with arrest warrant"
will come at your place.
"Your drivers license will
be canceled, and everything"
"under your name, like your
property, your bank account,"
everything will be seized.
"You'll also face federal
imprisonment for up to five years."
Now the total balance outstanding
"on your name is $6,485."
#NAME?
"I don't know, I don't
know anything about it."
I never heard any ...
"I didn't know anything
about all this stuff here."
"How do I pay it, is the question."

can do anything about this."
"An arrest warrant has already
been issued on your name,"
#NAME?
"- [Male] And we are already
moving but if you ..."

This is Abraham Holiday.

What's your name?
- [Abraham] Abraham Gark.
#NAME?
"The last gentleman said that
maybe nothing could be done,"
he didn't know.
"I don't want, I can't,
I don't have $6,000."
I didn't know about this IRS bill.
"- [Abraham] You don't need
to worry about anything, sir."
You see you haven't done anything wrong.
#NAME?
"- [Abraham] You don't need
to worry about anything."
"May I know if you are
at work or at home now?"
"- I'm at the, I'm at home."
I don't work right now.
I'm elderly and I ...
"- [Abraham] According to the
case, the case if for the year"
2012 to 2016.
"- 16. That's what he told me, yeah."
"- [Abraham] (mumbles)
they have done in old age."
#NAME?
"What do I do now, is what I wanna know."
I don't ...
"- [Abraham] I'll let you
know each and everything"
"about the case and I'll give
you fair chance to speak, okay?"
#NAME?
"- [Abraham] So the IRS has
done an audit on your taxes"
"for the year of 2012 til
2016 as we tried to send"
you some documents about the case.
"We have sent you the
documents but we didn't got"
any response back about that document.
- I didn't get anything.
"- [Abraham] So this is the
reason IRS takes, listen me."
#NAME?
"What, I just, I'll keep ..."
"- [Abraham] Well you can
take this case to the federal"
"courthouse or else you can
resolve it out of courthouse."
"If you don't resolve it out
of court, then you'll be"
"getting an optional 4 I
C offering compromise."
"Out of court house your
case will be handled by the"
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
"They will handle your case,
in which you'll be getting"
"a trial for about 45 minutes
to an hour to resolve the case."
"Before the IRS warrant, I
mean before the local police"
"department officer will be come
to your place to arrest you."
"But first we have to put the
arrest warrant on hold, got it?"
"- I think so, I've never done
anything like this before."
Where do I ...
"- [Abraham] I'll let you
know each and everything."
"But for payment plans you
should also have at least"
"$2,500 today, on today's date."
"Then only we can put the
arrest warrant on hold."
"- You would need $2,500 now to put"
the arrest warrant on hold?
"- [Abraham] Yes of course, sir."
It is only the possible way.
"You do understand sir
the arrest warrant has"
already been issued.
"- We only have $1,500 in
the bank until next month."
"- [Abraham] How much is it
possible for you to arrange?"
#NAME?
over the telephone.
"- [Abraham] We are not
authorized for that sir."
"I appreciate that but
we are not authorized."
"What you need to do go to Target, right."
I'll be over the phone.
"What you need to do in the
Target, there will be a"
different different card to use.
I'll be guiding you with (mumbles) there.
#NAME?
"- [Abraham] Once you buy
the card, I'll verify the"
bar codes and all.
"Simply you'll be buying an envelope,"
and you'll be sending the cards.
I'll be giving you the address.
That thing I'll guide you step by step.
#NAME?
"What kind of gift cards do
I have to get down there?"
"- [Abraham] Target. There
won't be different ones."
#NAME?
"- [Abraham] Yes, yes."
#NAME?
"- [Abraham] It'll be a
certain amount of it."
"- Yeah, that's good."
That sounds completely legitimate that
the IRS would do that.
"Now, I can call you when I get there?"
"- [Abraham] You'll have to
stay with me over the call."
I'll guide you step by step.
#NAME?
Keep me on the phone.
- [Abraham] Yes of course.
"Simply you need to take
on of your IDs, right ..."
#NAME?
"- [Abraham] Moving towards this tour,"
I'll update the case.
"Once we get done in the
parking lot don't say hello"
"back to me, sir."
- That'll be great.
That's fine with me.
I appreciate this.
"- [Abraham] Meanwhile if you
get any calls, just before"
you answer the call just let me know that.
#NAME?
"Does it make any difference
if I send my wife down?"
"- [Abraham] You will have
to do it, because you are"
the person I'm talking with.

any third party option.
I don't want your wife to be in trouble.

an old phone scam has resurfaced this
time it is targeting people who have
cell phones it's the one ring scam
thieves call you but then they hang up
and hope you'll be tempted to call them
back Pat foriegn explains unconsumed Pat
well Michelle ken this scam surfaced in
Western Canada but now it's happening
here in Ontario scammers call you and
then hang up if you call them back to
see who it is that's when you could be
charged hundreds of dollars Debbie Lea
says the unexpected phone call came late
at night it was like 10 to 12 and I kind
of looked at the number I never even
heard of this number I've never heard of
a place it came from Lea says the caller
didn't leave a voicemail but when she
googled the number it looked like it was
coming from Mauritania a country in
northwest Africa when you missed the
call scammers hope you will check your
phone and be curious enough to phone
them back but if you do that you'll be
charged a flat fee and charges per
minutes which could add up to hundreds
of dollars the Better Business Bureau
says it's similar to calling one 900
numbers that will result in charges on
your phone bill they may get music when
they they reconnect they may have a
pre-recorded message the longer they're
on the call obviously the more expensive
the call could end up being sometimes
you know $400 a minute the Canadian
anti-fraud Center says the calls are now
happening to unsuspecting people right
across the country it says to avoid the
one ring scam if your phone rings once
and you don't recognize the number
don't call back always check area codes
and phone numbers before returning a
random call and always check your phone
bill for unusual or unexpected charges
the numbers tend to change all the time
so blocking the number isn't really
helping you could receive 10 calls in a
week and they could be all from
different phone numbers Leah says she'll
be extra careful before returning any
calls where she doesn't recognize the
number and viewers say they're still
getting calls about the RCMP actually
it's CCR a scam and this is when someone
calls you and says if you don't pay back
taxes you'll be arrested by the RCMP and
Revenue Canada doesn't operate that way
it's a scam on your side I pad for it

"11 feet, 11 feet."
It's no secret that carnivals exist to make money
"And to do this most effectively, they do a bunch of little tricks"
to make you overestimate your chances of winning
in some cases to such an extent
that it’s basically a scam. So I spent a couple days coming down
to this carnival and observing and collecting data
on all the games. So I’m now I’m going to tell
you exactly which games are the biggest ripoffs and the scientific reasons why.
I even nancy drewed how much they actually pay
for the prizes you can win. But there is hope…because I’ll also
show you some legitimate tricks on how to the most popular
games and along
with what happens when you show up to the carnival with your professional baseball playing buddy
who happens to play for the Mets.
Let’s get started!
Any kind of legitimate investigation needs to start with solid data
"as the foundation. So with the promise of unlimited churros,"
I had some friends secretly help me collect data on all 24
"games at the Carnival for a full day.
Not only did we collect"
how how many times each game was played but we recorded how many
times people actually won each game and what prize they won.
And so the first observation was that based on our data
is tht this relatively small park
this place makes $20k/day just on their carnival
"So to help frame the rest of the observations,"
"let’s divide the games into 3 groups.
1st,"
You’ve got your Random chance games-
Games like these that don’t utilize any skills and are basically
"rolling a dice.
2nd you’ve got your Skill based games"
Like basketball shot or the milk bottle throw or the basket toss
game where if you bring some kind of skill or strategy to the table
"you can increases your chances of winning
And the final category are"
the games that are pretty much Impossible- These ones are borderline
"scams.
There are 3 games that"
"lots of people attempted and nobody won, and if they did win"
"once like in the case of the ladder climb it was for a very specific reason,"
which I’ll talk about later.
So let’s start by talking about the random chance games. Calculating
your chances of winning chances here is pretty straightforward. You just divide
winning outcomes by the total outcomes
"and you’ll get a percentage.
So in this case there are about about 1600"
total cups and 160 winning cups.
That’s about 10% chance or 1 in 10 throws
"will win.
There are a ton of games similar to"
this. But catch is they always use balls that are light weight and have a high
coefficient of restitution meaning they bounce really well.
The makes it much less likely the ball will end
where you originally aim it.
"To illustrate this point, think how much easier this game would be with"
bean bags which are heavier with and don’t bounce.
Any imperfection
"in your throw is magnified, which essentially"
"randomizes things.
If you have no skills these"
are the games you want to play. But don’t’ get too excited
because even when you win you lose.
I did some investigative work and uncovered the sources they order
their prizes from and discovered even If you got lucky
on your first throw that would cost you $1.50
for a prize that that cost them 45 cents.
But you usually won’t get it on your first try
and treating this as expected value problem it would
take you average
(7/30) 5 tries to land in a yellow cup for a small prize which means you pay $7.50
for something that costs 45 cents.
In the case of the big prize by landing in the rare
gold cup it’s worse and would take an average of
"25 tries, which works out to $38"
for a prize that costs them $6.
The number of people we observed winning matched up well with these
statistical predictions.Now let’s talk about the
skill based games. One of the most popular
the basketball toss with 825
the day we obseved. A standard 3 pointer is
about 24 feet back on a 10 foot rim.
"In this case however, the line is 28ft back on a rim"
11 feet high. Which is subtle but if
you have a deadly 3 pointer locked
into your muscle memory you will tend to miss short which is
"exactly what happened a bunch.
The reason they always have all big sloped tarp in front"
is so that someone can’t stand underneath the rim where they height difference
would be much more apparent.
Here again though even if you go Steph Curry
"and sink your first $3 shot, you still lose 2.20 cents"
because this ball costs them 80 cents Here is another example of getting
you to overestimate your chances of winning by making subtle changes by slanting the table
which will reduce the horizontal velocity after
the bounce so even if you played this game all through college
your previous experience almost becomes a handicap.
This measure your pitch speed game is borderline fraudulent
as their Radar gun registers about 15mph slow.
"I know this because I measured the distance and then
 
 
filmed in high speed"
and counted the frames and this pitch was much closer to 84 mph.
For the milk bottle game the only catch here is that the bottles are metal
which makes them more stable and harder to knock down than a normal bottle that size.
I’ve seen some carnivals where they are bottom weighted
which would make them even more stable and thus less likely to tip.
You can ask to hold it use the trick
of balance it on your finger to determine where the center of mass is.
They key to this game is hitting them right here
with a hard enough throw to introduce sufficient kinetic energy
but don’t throw it too hard because we noticed those who threw their hardest
usually compromised on accuracy.
About 1 in 14 of people knocked them over on their first try.
And then finally the basket toss game. The key here is to
have your first bounce hit on the front lip to reduce the kinetic energy
enough so it doesn’t rebound out.
About 1 in 10 people win this game according to our observations.
And now this brings us to our final category of the near impossible
"games and there are three of them. On this first one, the goal"
is to shoot out the red star with this automatic
bb gun. So the best strategy is to basically shoot
"a circle around the start to cut it out.
Not only"
are the guns not accurate or precise but the bigger issue is
that you start out doing really well because there is enough surrounding paper
"so the bb will rip through the paper.
But Newton’s"
3rd law tells us you can only push on something as hard
as it can resist your push and so at the end there will be barely
supported pieces of the star that just move out of the way
off the bb without building up enough stress
to rip the paper. Out of 120 plays we saw
"no one win this one all day
This ring bottle game"
"is also impossibly difficult. Again, it’s a lightweight object"
that is really bouncy to encourage randomness
but the actual inner diameter of the ring is really close
to the outer diameter of the bottle. This means any throw
"besides this perfect one, will"
send it bouncing away instead of settling in on the bottle.
If you really want this bear I suggest going to Amazon and getting it for $47.
I literally can’t even tell you how much money that wills save you because of the 840
"rings we saw thrown, none stayed on. Which brings"
"up a obvious rule of thumb, if you want"
"to have the feeling of winning a game, don’t play any game that offers"
really big prizes.  And for the final near impossible
game let me reiterate that for a carnival owner the most lucrative
games are those which the customer over
estimates their chances of success. No game is a better example
"of this than the ladder climb.
There is a subtle issue"
"with this game that I think people realize, but don’t internalize the significance."
The ladder converges to be supported on the wall by one point
instead of two. If it was attached in two points it’s like
crawling across a bridge
which is really easy. Let’s pretend this is
you and If you shrunk all the weight of your body
"down to the average location which we call the center of mass,"
which we’ll mark
"with this dot. Again, you know this is the spot"
because it balances perfectly. If you draw
two imaginary lines connecting the diffrent support points
and as long as your center of mass dot is
it is impossible to fall off.
But As soon as you center of mass is even a little bit out of the area
of supports you start to rotate and fall off.
If you’ve ever bent over to pick something up
you actually know this fact whether you realize it or not.
In this case the region of support is between the heel
"and the toes of your foot.
When you reach over you will"
naturally move your butt back to keep your center of mass
"in between your support points.
If you don’t believe me"
try picking something up standing against a wall
"so you can move your butt back, at the very moment your center of mass"
"moves beyond your toes,"
"you tip over.
In the case of the ladder game even though it looks wide because of the ladder rungs, it’s only attached"
at one point but
even though it looks wide because of the ladder rungs
that area of support reduces down to a line. So
So if you don’t keep your center of mass directly above that line
"you will start to rotate and fall
off. In other words, to win this game"
you basically need to crawl across a tightrope.
And you might think we’ll I can do a slack line so I can do
this but a slack line is actually much easier for 2 reasons
You can flail your arms and legs out to adjust
your center of mass to keep it above the line
of support and your center of mass is higher
up which makes you more stable
In the same way it’s easier to balance this umbrella when it’s extended vs. when collapsed.
So while there are a few videos that say tricks like maintain three points
"of contact at all times, they’re basically useless because"
keeping your center of mass directly above a line
is just something you need get a feel for that
takes a lot of practice. But once you’ve had enough practice you this is the one game at the
carnival that is all skill. So you can win everytime
"and clean them out. Unfortunately, the carnival owner knows this which is why it’s"
the only game with this super lame caveat.
"So now that we were carnival experts, I called up my buddy Matt Winaker"
who played baseball for Stanford and was just recently drafted to play for the New York Mets
So we could maximize the chance of winning any game relating to throwing
So clearly Matt had deadly lock on any throwing game
But basketball is more my game so to finish off
the day I decided to bring his ego back into check
"As it turns out, if you are a world
class athlete in one sport"
"you are a really, really good athlete in all sports."
"So in conclusion, you should play the games if you think they’re fun"
just know that the odds are heavily stacked against so if you
don’t win it’s nbd unlike this dude who lost his
life savings playing carnival games. And if
your motivation is to gain the love and admiration of someone
special by means of a stuffed animal you don’t need a
carnival to do that. Amazon works just as well.

are you ready to hang up on me all right
well I guess we got rid of him yep we
got ready
all right this is Steve from Comcast you
need to follow these steps and turn off
your internet yes II didn't realize
though they did call the Anne Arundel
County Police Department sure O'Connor
I'll what happened with this story today
yeah Kelly and Jamie a prankster reaches
the Anne Arundel County Police
Department and instead of hanging up on
the 5-minute call a police sergeant
makes it a lesson for the rest of us the
phone rings the call is transferred to
the businessman in a heavy accent he
said hi my name is Steven I'm from
Comcast
I'm from the IT technical department he
says that I need to follow his
instructions or our internet was going
our Comcast Internet was gonna be shut
off what the caller doesn't realize he's
talking to a police sergeant he wanted
access to get into my computer sergeant
Dan sereboff kept asking questions but
wasn't fooled for a second when the call
came in to the Anne Arundel County
police training facility in Davidson
Ville Wednesday afternoon the man on the
other line wanted access to his computer
which could have been a disaster for the
department or anyone who falls for the
prank I do a lot of purchasing for the
facility so he very easily could have
gotten access to government bank
accounts a 5-minute call then came the
big reveal I said Steve you called the
police department and he said I've
called what I said yes you've called the
police department click it clicked for
the veteran police sergeant but he wants
to make sure someone else doesn't cave
to the pressure of cold calls and
demands asking some key questions will
help employee ID numbers are one
callback numbers and-and-and-and ask the
right questions and if it feels wrong
and is wrong janna Comcast spokesperson
is looking into the details of the call
but she reminds us it's not typical for
Comcast's to make a cold call and took
requests information on your computer a
prank for the wrong person turned into a
lesson for the rest of us Cheryl Conner
ABC 2 News
hi guys this is Ranjit and in this video
I'll quickly give you a demo of whatsapp
video calling feature and also there is
a scam going on right now regarding this
video calling don't fall for that I'll
talk about that also so let's make a
video call let's open this whatsapp and
we're going to make a video call to emit
bomani who's the chief editor of phone
radar so let's make a call and you have
to just update your whatsapp application
you don't need any invites or anything
like that when as you can see we see
this calling icon and if you click on
this now we get two options that's voice
calls and video calls let's make a a
video call and I'm gonna make and I you
can see me and let's see if I'm throwing
picks that up it's ringing
so as you can see I've made the money
this is how much money he picked up the
call hi I met so we are doing a demo for
this video calling feature on whatsapp
so this is I'm using Wi-Fi so this
should be good you're using what kind of
connection yeah I think so yeah even for
this mobile data it is good there is a
little bit of pixelation that I can see
but overall the the call quality is good
definitely if you are on Wi-Fi think so
it should be a lot better yeah for this
quantity but yeah I have no connection
that's the thing that's the thing with
whatsapp it's so popular and it's like
de facto standard anybody who gets a new
phone will install whatsapp so I don't
think so yeah these days I don't get
even from official stuff I don't get the
sms's but I get whatsapp disconnected
yeah that's the thing another thing is
that what do you think now about Google
duo because you are a very prominent
user of Google duo but I told you this
is not going to take off I told you okay
do you remember it's too late I mean
it's too late I think some whatsapp has
become the sort of the standard now and
that's not going to change okay about
the scam of this video calling feature
there's a lot of lakhs of misconceptions
and stuff going on and I think so you
also your family members also got that
for what it's actually malware it's not
malware and like what you say it just
don't do it just don't do it
so again looks good even on a mobile
data you are on a mobile connection so
still looks good so if you are on Wi-Fi
it should be really good so I think so
this is going to become the whatsapp
video calling will become a de facto
standard in my opinion so again our
thanks for your time and coming and
giving us a demo of this whatsapp video
calling I mean also do share that
screenshot of that malicious app I will
just put that out in this video so again
guys I'm at thanks for this video talk

so guys as you can see it was a very
simple thing you just tap here decide
what you want you want a voice call or a
video call and you can easily make the
same and again I don't fall for those
scams just update your whatsapp from the
Google Play Store and this also works on
Apple phones so updated so just download
it from Apple Store so guys that's it

[Music]
hey everyone scammers are impersonating
your elderly friends on facebook
again
[Music]
so i got a friend request from someone
named larry which was weird because i'm
already friends with a guy named larry
who uses this exact same profile picture
oh well whatever you can never have too
many friends so i accepted his request
and then he later sends me a message
saying hello how are you doing hope all
is well with you
okay i know what's going on here this is
a scammer who's impersonating larry and
he's hoping that i won't realize that
it's the new larry messaging me
and not the old larry that i've been
friends with all along and then he's
gonna shoot the ball with me for a few
minutes and then tell me to contact some
government agent about
some big grant that i should apply for i
made a whole video about this scam last
year you can click right here
and check it out but i decided that i
was going to pull that same scam on him
before he could pull it on me so i said
hi larry yes all is well in fact things
are fantastic
and he gives me a thumbs up and i said i
just benefited from a great sum of money
have you heard about the new united
states development grant
i just qualified for it and i think you
might too
and larry perks right up and he says how
can i get that
and i said you just need to apply for it
i got mine in under a week
i give you the phone number of the agent
that helped me
and he said okay do that so i said okay
here is his number his name is agent
hugh
jass a huge ass though somebody check
the men's room for a huge ass please
contact him and let him know i referred
you
so then i get a text message on the
google voice number that i gave larry
so yes it's me i am agent
hugh jass i'm huge ass telephone
i said thanks for the message may i ask
who this is
larry says i want to apply and i said is
this in regards to the development grant
and he said again i want to apply
i said good to hear i'll just need some
personal information to see if you
qualify
if you'd like you can send me that via
text will that work
and he said what i said i need some
information from you before i can
disperse the funds
please send over your full name and
birthday and i can look you up
are you there hello are you still
interested
and at this point larry probably
realizes that he doesn't have any of the
information on this guy that he's
impersonating
other than a profile picture so he just
goes quiet
so that's when he goes back to the real
me and tries to get me with the same
scam that i'm getting him with
so he says have you heard anything about
ggf yet
ugh see i told you i said no
global grant fund helping everyone with
cash they are helping the young
old retired citizen workers and
non-workers disabled or non-disabled
i applied before gotten the money you
could also use it
and i'm like that's nice but i already
received money from the development
grant
you can also apply for the again
whatever i said okay should i share you
their agent page
okay click on the link and message them
he is agent tom white so i click on the
link and i see that agent tom white has
a grand total of
one person that likes him
looks official so i do a reverse search
on his image and it's a california
congressman named
buck mckeon these scammers are so dumb
why am i wasting my time doing this
well because i love you guys and i want
you to have some enjoyable content
so i message agent white and i say hi
agent white can you help me apply for
the grant
please who is this and how may i help
you
whoa lay off the caps tom i said my
name's ben
larry sent me please hold let me run a
checkup on our database let me check if
your profile name
is still available on our grant
opportunity list
congratulations your name appear on our
system names are chosen in an automated
random base your name was listed among
the winning people
this guy's had way too much coffee i
said nice
let us know when you are ready to claim
it and i'm like
ready as i'll ever be so he asked me for
a bunch of personal info to apply for
the money
and i just give him a bunch of bs and
then i wait to see if my application
will go through
and that's when my friend larry on the
other chat decides to check in on me
so this is very confusing we got larry
talking to me but we also have larry
talking to my made-up agent
hugh jass who's also played by me and
larry thinks he's fooling me by having
me talk to his made-up agent tom white
who's most likely the same guy as larry
so this is quite a web that we've spun
for each other
larry says have you messaged him yet
i said yes did you message agent hugh
jass
yes okay great so i guess we'll both
just wait for applications to get
reviewed
and then larry decides to make some
small talk and he says
what about you what is going on with you
and so i just make up a bunch of crap to
see how he would respond
i say well the co-ed restrictions have
been hard on all of us
we weren't able to have thanksgiving at
aunt karen's this year
we still don't know what that means for
christmas are you coming into town or
staying in boise he says staying in
boise
larry doesn't live in boise he just
lives up the street but good for him for
trying to be clever
anyway i decide to call him out on going
silent with agent jass and i say
i just messaged agent jess and he has
not heard from you
he needs your address to verify so then
larry says
doing that right now so then larry
starts texting agent jas
saying hello and then i i mean agent
jass
says hi larry ben just gave me your
address
and he gives me his name again and then
i say thanks i'll start the process and
have more info
soon right now the grant has set aside 7
500
for senior citizens as part of the
stimulus package passed by congress
earlier
this year we need to act quick because
the funds aren't available after
december 31st
to speed things up just let me know how
you prefer to be paid we can direct
deposit into your bank or we can mail a
check to the address ben
gave and then freaking larry goes quiet
because once again he's too dumb
to come up with a way to claim his money
and that's when he turns into agent tom
and writes me back with instructions on
how to claim my money
you were to pay 500 for the delivery
fees and clearance fees to your winning
money
wow so i go back to larry and i say holy
crap they want me to pay 500
larry says i paid 700 to get my money if
i knew this is real i would have choosed
higher
i said well i don't have 500 on me
you can tell them how much you can
afford and then i come up with a great
idea
i say well what if you lend me 500 then
i pay you back when i get my big money
i don't have if i have i will give you
can tell them how much you can afford
and i thought well if you would just
write agent jazz back you'd get your
money and then you can lend it to me you
idiot
i said tell the agent you want direct
deposit then you'll get your 7 500
then you can lend me 500
i can't right now i think you should go
and borrow it from the bank
okay so that's not going to work i go
back to agent tom and i say
why am i getting this money again and he
says is your right
my right did you know that you have
rights
the constitution says you do and then
tom says are you ready to make the
payment now
this is such a stupid scam are there
really people out there who send 500
because they think that they're going to
get a payment of 140 000
from this idiot i say sure
do you have any walmart store in your
area there i said i think so
go to the store and purchase walmart
gift card of 100
and five pieces how many minutes would
it take you to reach there
okay so since western union has gotten
so strict on who you can send money to
i guess they've resorted to gift cards
which can easily be exchanged for
bitcoin
which is also really bizarre to think
that some people believe that you can
pay the government with
walmart gift cards anyway i say
well it's quite far but i can get gift
cards closer
will these cards work and what i've done
is i've created a link at grabify.link
that will snag his ipinfo
telling me where he is right now if he
clicks on it
but facebook doesn't allow me to send
this kind of a link so i've got somehow
text it to him so i tell agent tom that
my battery is dying and i need him to
text me
so he does and he says are you there
with me
i said yes he said go to the store and
purchase
walmart gift card of in five pieces
let me know once you get that okay
i said i'll have them soon okay no
problem let me know once you get it
okay so i wait a couple of minutes and
then i say
what do i do when i get them you will
have to scratch the bat
code gently and send it to me here with
the receipt
so then i create another graphify link
to an image of a random gift card and i
send it to him
and the fool does in fact click on my
link
let's find out where he is
oh it's nigeria why is it always nigeria
tom says scratch the back code of the
card and send it to me here with the
receipt
and then i said i will do that when you
do something for me
what's that i said i run a youtube
channel and i need to do some marketing
since you're in lagos nigeria will you
hold up a sign outside on a street that
says subscribe to pleasant green
on youtube if you do that i'll send you
the gift card info
and then he plays dumb and he's like
what do you mean by lagos nigeria
oh this idiot i said look i just hacked
your ip address
and i sent him an image then a minute
later
he says kindly send the card and the
receipt so that i can use it to confirm
your winning money
i said if you're not going to send me
the picture that i asked for then kindly
shut up and leave me alone and then he
left me alone but a day later larry
writes me back and he says hello
i said hi my delivery money
i said okay take a picture of where you
are and send it to me
so he takes a screenshot of some random
house he found on google maps
i said you stole that from google i can
see the google markings
you're in nigeria he said what do you
mean
holy crap these people i said do as i
ask or go away
my friend told me about this grant i
don't understand
and i'm like okay let me help you i'm in
usa
you're in nigeria i need someone in
nigeria to hold up a sign that says
subscribe to pleasant green on youtube
and then i need a picture if you do this
i'll pay you 100
if you don't i will find someone else to
do it
understand and then larry
went quiet again so
let me just take a minute here and say
that i know that i've got a lot of guys
in nigeria
that watch my videos in fact i've had
about 7 000 views from nigeria just in
the last
few days and if you're in nigeria and
you're watching right now
i just want to point out how stupid your
friend was i offered him a hundred
dollars if he would just take a simple
picture for me and he just wouldn't do
it
i don't know if he didn't believe me or
what but
it's his loss and since he's not going
to take me up on my offer
i'm going to extend the offer to all of
you and so if you're in
nigeria or ghana or kenya or somewhere
in africa
and you want to make some money honestly
then do what this idiot didn't do and
take a picture for me
just go out in the street and have a
buddy hold up a sign that says subscribe
to pleasant green on youtube
you can hide your face but send me a
picture
you can send it to me on instagram my
username is pleasantgrn
i couldn't get a handle with the full
name so it's just pleasant grn
i think some marijuana dealer got the
real handle but i'm going to give a 25
walmart gift card to the 10 best
pictures i get
no questions asked the 10 pictures that
i like the most
get a gift card except whoever takes the
best picture
gets a 100 walmart gift card
actually make that two 100
walmart gift cards
[Music]
i'm gonna take all the money that i make
off this video and i'm gonna give it to
the good people of nigeria
but you guys gotta work for it i'm
looking for photos that are the highest
quality
or the most creative or the ones that
make me laugh
so who out there is gonna give me what i
need i'll have these gift cards sitting
on my desk and i'll scratch them off and
i'll send them to you or
whatever you want but only if you've got
one of the top 10 best pictures

go do something worthwhile
and if you do i'll reward you for it
and i'll make another video showing
everybody how you did
so we're all counting on you guys so go
out there with your phones find some
poster board and show us

oh it says well I'm just calling it up
now it says warning scam by so-called BT
technical team that tries to get you to
install TeamViewer I was called by a
member of the BT technical team from
India who asked me whether I knew that
my internet was going to be disconnected
I said no and he informed me that due to
hackers trying to use my IP address and
internet server to send out fraudulent
emails he would need to clean certain
files from my computers hello hello
hello
hello
[Music]
hello hello hello
you
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
hi I'm a Haitian global techinique how
may I help you yeah hi I was on my
computer and all of a sudden like a pop
up came up and my computers like frozen
now I can't do anything I just said to
call this number
she also via Apple certified you really
mode access to your computer and let me
take the problem sure
so the softwares can show that your
system is full of viruses and malware
there are at least a thousand problems
with the system and we have a security
package for you that is just five
hundred dollars or one year if you don't
buy our package right away and I'm sorry
to inform you that your system will
never ever ever ever recover of this
problem and major I'd estimate all right
I guess so
[Music]
so what can be happen there
so the fault HIDA computer never had a
single virus the pop-up you saw his
computer was sent by my hated company to
seek the man out what my hate is trying
to do now
it convinced Harry to buy an expensive
security package for a problem that
never existed on this computer that is
the scam
damn the FTC is once again receiving
phone calls about scammers claiming to
work for the Social Security
Administration 13 Action News reporter
Nina portion kula explains how the scam
works and what you can do to protect
yourself yeah Beth and Dana it's easy to
think you're never going to fall for
these schemes but crooks they get very
creative and this time they're tricking
people into telling them they need to
reactivate their suspended social
security number because of some
connection to fraud or other criminal
activity they'll ask you to call a
number to clear it up where they'll try
to get your personal information they
pretend to be protecting you from a scam
while they're trying to lure you into
one but here's the thing Social Security
numbers do not get suspended this is
just another government imposters scam
and we asked financial expert Steve
butan what's the one thing you should
know to keep your information safe the
best way not to fall for these scams is
to never give out anything over the
phone if it's a legitimate agency a
legitimate company they'll contact you
by the mail and then you could always
call them but I would never ever ever
give out information over the phone and
here's some more tips to keep in mind do
not trust a name phone number or email
address con artists use official
sounding names caller Ids or email
addresses slow down and do some research
online and if you already sent money to
a scammer contact the company you use to
send the money and tell them the
transaction was a fraud now if someone
has tried to steal your personal
information pretending to be from a
government energy report it to the FTC
and you can do it directly online on
their website
listen I've taken some of those phone
calls and they sound so real that I hang
up and then I think oh gosh I hope I
didn't hang up yes you know you kind of
second-guess yourself so great advice to
just double-check take your time Thank
You Nina
this morning metros look
"welcome back everyone to another episode
of marketing Thursdays and roofing"
"insights and today I'm talking about
Yelp and how they scam contractors as a"
"matter of fact they tricked me a couple
of months ago now again and I can't wait"
"to share that conversation what yelps
doing to get us and how you can get out"
"of it thanks so much for coming so I
want to say about a couple of years ago"
"I first tried Yelp back then they won a
12-month contract one of the biggest"
"problem with Yelp is they always wants
that 12 month agreement okay the thing"
"about those 12 month agreement for me
that's the first red flag for any"
"contractor anybody who wants your
business for 12 months you want"
"commitment it says more about them than
about their business let me explain if"
"you know that you're doing really good
service you know you deliver leads you"
"know you you know it's like handshake
greatly you know when we shake hands and"
"you say hey I'm gonna do this for you
why do you want to lock me down for 12"
"months Yelp always knowing and all the
best cameras bad companies out there who"
"never deliver results in the reason is
this they can't deliver results so they"
"know if they make it tons of promises in
the beginning and they have you for 12"
"months you're gonna be scared of your
credit history be ruined they they have"
"your bank account they have your debit
card what's not and they know how to get"
"you in the back and they have
collections they have you know what"
"forget about it they are scammers and
companies like Yelp for example I always"
"try to negotiate what's the best for me
and all this BS talk about you have to"
"give it I know you don't this is
business"
"if you paint somebody let's say $350 per
month that's a car payment you know you"
"can literally write a write a truck or
car for"
"$350 a month why would I pay somebody
350 for 12 months if I don't get even a"
"return or give it a try blah blah blah
listen to this conversation give me"
"options what's your what's my option
advertising okay so it sounds it sounds"
"like it's too good to be true because a
lot of times it is so four years ago I"
"negotiated this deal for 350 but instead
of 12 months I did it for 3 months it"
"was super super hard the way I got
around yelled back then about it it was"
"I think August and I told him listen
we're going in the winter time I'm dead"
"in 4 month I know you're not getting
deliver anything you know cash is gonna"
"be tight in my business I wanna try for
three months so I did like August"
"September October three months the
busiest month by the way and sure enough"
"not a single job but you do the mess
what is it eleven fifty something like"
"that so they cost me I paid them 1154
ads for whatever I knew I didn't get"
"anything because we track every single
call how did you hear about us we'll put"
"it on our CRM with you all of that good
stuff"
"so I can go and run analytics I'm like
no nobody ever called me because they've"
"seen an ad there
I'm out of 1,150 bucks and now Yelp also"
"is really really bad about flagging down
good reviews and keeping the bad ones I"
"mean we have that problem and it's just
like they have the worst out of all the"
"worst companies out there Yelp is the
worst one comes to reviews business"
"owners hates them I'm like I don't
understand how they stay in business but"
"this time we decided to try them again
so I called them up and I asked them"
"what does it take to be in business with
you today how much money this and this"
"time we didn't even talk about monthly
fee or anything so the sales page of"
"Yelp representative we have 20 minutes
talk with them was $900 credit this is"
"how they get you guys credit towards
your campaign and then you have to set"
"up five that's what they recommend to
$15 daily budgets so Demetri you do this"
"budget five 10 15 dollars today and see
how the rolls give at a time whatever"
"and we're gonna pay you $900 well
no-brainer right like if it works and"
"you pay for it why would I do it but we
have to have a credit card on file"
"okay sounds good so and I make I made so
sure I keep asking question how does it"
"work
where is gonna apply and so on Carl does"
"$900 gets applied so now I didn't sign
any agreements I'm literally on the"
"phone with the guy all he's saying that
I'm gonna set up daily budget 5-2 now"
"we're not talking about 350 a month he's
like me"
"we just need your credit card that's all
it is"
"give us a credit card set up a daily
budget so I'm gonna be spending $15 a"
"day in and as far as we're gonna pay you
900 arcs and if it doesn't work you know"
"what it doesn't work but if it does work
you know of course I would be happiest"
"person on earth okay because guess what
yell porch all the Sinhalese how many"
"people come in to them right I want to
be in front of those people so sure"
"enough we sign up give them credit card
not thinking much about it less than two"
"months later and I give them my Amex
card the reason I gave them a max card"
"American Express because I know how easy
it is to dispute transaction with the"
"Amex so you dispute it you literally go
to your bank call Amex and say card was"
"not present didn't authorize
transactions that's it they're out of"
"money so now I have two months $500 plus
per month that Yelp is charging me so"
"I'm calling like why charge me over 500
arsim a month they they telling me that"
"I have now 12 month agreement and guys I
can actually she listened for entire"
"conversation an agreement of what I just
want to try it and if it works we'll use"
it a lot okay okay
"like you told me you give me 900 hour
credit to try it out and I'm setting up"
"daily budget what kind of agreement I
have so now apparently that $900 is not"
"working they charge me another 500 bucks
the biggest problem"
"of entire thing I didn't get one single
call I didn't get one single message I"
"don't know how many clicks we're getting
I mean what am I paying for I'm paying"
"for the air imagine your business if you
go in and you build a website and you"
"just convince the world somehow that the
website is popular I mean it's great"
"great great for you that you have
popular website like y'all but now you"
"want to charge money people just to be
on your website just for their"
"information I mean here blah blah blah
we'll push in front of all people who"
"comes to this popular website okay well
it's one thing to have something popular"
"but another thing that people who comes
to the website actually looking for your"
"service and that rarely happens to
roofers the contractors and Yelp"
"I mean I don't know any contractor and
trust me I go to breakout sessions I go"
"to conference where thousands attend I
mean I go on a stage and as guys hey"
"raise your hand if you have success with
Yelp raise your hand if this worked for"
"you guess what
never happens never ever happens you"
"can't find those people so but how did
they scare us how do they find us little"
"gimmicks like this you know even if you
record an entire conversation so I have"
"recent conversation with Yelp disputing
this charges now $500"
"I have two transactions over $500 of my
Amex and I don't want to pay because I"
"didn't get any value I didn't authorize
them today anything so they're like whoa"
"but do you sign an agreement I'm like no
do you want me to send you phone"
"conversation of how I set up my billing
with you I can send a wall so you do"
"recognize you do confirm that you
actually spoke with us and you have this"
"agreement know it don't you ask me to
give a credit card so you can add $900"
to my campaign
"it's gonna ask you for your billing
information and when you're done typing"
"that in do not press purchase because I
have to give you a code to get the $900"
"in free ads okay sounds good so anyway
guys Yelp is very very shady company I'm"
"saying it how it is they're gonna trick
you any what possible way they can they"
"also will never ever be on your side
when it comes to reviews as a matter of"
"fact we have 9 reviews right now eight
of them are positive one of them is"
"negative and only three of them shows so
they took six negative reviews six"
"positive reviews off website is not
recommending there are solid customers I"
"give you address I give you a homeowner
last first name everything I can give"
"you invoice what would you for them so
they took down six and they only display"
"three one of them is bad so my rating is
like three point five stars if they"
"would consider those six my rating would
be four point eight stars so Yelp never"
"takes site of the contractor it only
takes site of people who write reviews"
"for for living who is usually very mad
people not happy with anything else and"
"only one is complaint complaint
complaint that's like one of the reviews"
"we have we actually have to make YouTube
video about the job in about that"
"homeowner because all the homeowner all
he does goes in and writes negative"
"reviews and restaurants and paths count
like all his her experiences anyway be"
"very very careful with the Yelp for me
personally it stands for zero results in"
"guys if you do have great success with
Yelp if you're the business owner please"
"comment below I want to hear from you I
want to hear how much you're spending"
"how much money Yelp helps you to
generate how many sales how many people"
"Yelp selling to you maybe you happy to
pay you know this dollar amounts you're"
"gonna be unique herb for me but if you
exist I want to have interview with you"
"bring you to our show maybe we can teach
the world how to use Yelp because right"
"now I don't understand that I know
stuff my audience don't understand it"
"somebody need to teach us because Yelp
only trying to scam us they're not"
"teaching us how to use their platform
after that phone conversation I didn't"
"get one single email I didn't get one
single phone call about this 5 or $15"
"budget as far as I'm concerned Yelp did
not do Ethan on their end it's not like"
"the comparison that that representative
when he charged me and offer me that"
"$900 did he keep saying well this is
like Google pay-per-click except Google"
"pay-per-click you have a person creating
ads running your keywords choosing"
"targeting areas choosing your options at
Yelp nobody does it you literally"
"painfull listing that doesn't work so
hope guys it helps if you like our"
"content don't forget to subscribe to

this rant is sponsored by AT&T Thank You
AT&T for sponsoring this video I
sponsored rich yeah this video as far as
to deal with it the ad pocalypse is upon
us y'all I'm canceling the ad pocalypse
Latino what AT&T for this video is
because of the service that they wanted
me to talk about something I am totally
behind because there's one thing I
cannot stand with my phone
other than my paranoid thoughts I think
it's listening to me at all times are
those ridiculous unwanted fraudulent
spam solicitor phone calls I can't stand
them and a lot of you can't stand them
either I asked you about this on Twitter
and you share it with me some of your
craziest fraud spam call stories look
for some of your tweets in this video we
are in a digital age who is still making
direct phone calls to try to sell
products or get our information everyone
knows about spam emails we have an
entire folder in our inbox dedicated to
spam emails that we totally check every
single day right everyone yeah companies
we check that spam folder all the time
every morning I wake up I just go oh man
I can't wait to see what's in my spam
for today gonna put it on my sandwich
that solicitor's that still think to do
cold calls or probably the same people
walking around with Walkmans or
recording their favorite television
shows on VHS tape or saving their
computer data on a three-and-a-half inch
floppy disk and if they are calling you
on the phone is probably one of those
Saved by the Bell Zack Morris brick
phones are those old landlines where you
could see to the phone or maybe even
that phone with the eyeballs on it I
don't know what they do
apparently they live it in the Stone Age
it's probably little bird from the
Flintstones in there calling you going
it's a lemon and these ancient relics
obviously don't know about caller ID
because we can look at the phone number
and see the number we don't recognize
and just be like no thank you

from Pennsylvania I don't know anybody
from Pennsylvania sometimes I forget
that piss Albania is a state where is

Magic Kingdom in Orlando Tennessee the
king in this case being Elvis when you
wish upon a star oh yeah
play ro much but in the rare case they
trick us to pick up that phone
telemarketers have gotten to the point
where their tactics are just so stupid
like you're not even trying hard to be
good at their craft it's like they got
the job they know no one likes them they
know they're gonna get yelled at all day
so they just stop caring and gave us the
worst sales pitches of all time to try
to trick us into getting information

calling you about a virus on your
computer how would you even know that

fire ten forty where the tax company
hey you guys that's a fake call we're
spider-man when you need them and if the

weekends early in the morning late at
night 11 p.m. 11 p.m. offering me life
insurance I asked a telemarketer if they

house I should be the new Blum House
film telemarketer or someone calls you
and you hang up on them they're actually
inside the house and they get you you're
welcome Blum house if somebody is
calling you late at night it's either
something really really bad or something
really really good or somebody wants to
see you personally for some fun time not
for home auto finance loans oh baby you
know what I love when someone calls me
at 12:30 in the morning to tell me about
a new credit card that I couldn't get
with only twelve point nine eight P our
own percentage rate Oh seriously I would
have to say when they called me about
repairing my roof and my roof don't need
to be repaired that's funny because I
got one of those once about the home
that I owned oh do I own a house
somewhere is it between them Iscariot
what kind of it does it like what kind
of youtuber do you think I am have you
seen my views so solicitors
telemarketers and spammers give it up
your ways are tired and all you're doing

ABOUT YOURSELF AND DESCRIBE
NATIONAL CONSUMER
PROTECTION WEEK?
">> SURE, TRACY."
THANK YOU.
IT'S GREAT TO BE ON FACEBOOK
LIVE WITH YOU TO TALK ABOUT
SCAMS THAT EFFECT SO
MANY PEOPLE.
"AND AS YOU MENTIONED, I AM WITH"
THE DIVISION OF CONSUMER AND
BUSINESS EDUCATION AT THE FTC.
AND IT'S OUR JOB TO EDUCATE
PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR RIGHTS AND
BUSINESSES ABOUT THEIR
RESPONSIBILITIES.
AND WE DO THAT IN A LOT OF WAYS.
WE'RE CONSTANTLY CREATING
"EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS, AND"
WORKING WITH PARTNER
ORGANIZATIONS TO SPREAD THE WORD
ABOUT SCAMS.
NATIONAL CONSUMER PROTECTION
"WEEK, NCPW, IS A TIME TO REALLY"
FOCUS ON HELPING PEOPLE KNOW HOW
"TO SPOT AND AVOID SCAMS, SO THEY"
CAN MAKE WELL-INFORMED DECISIONS
TO PROTECT THEIR HARD
EARNED MONEY.
IT'S A COORDINATED CAMPAIGN
THAT TAKES PLACE DURING THE
FIRST WEEK OF MARCH EVERY YEAR.
WE BRING TOGETHER GOVERNMENT
"AGENCIES, WITH NATIONAL"
"ORGANIZATIONS, STATE AND LOCAL"
"PARTNERS, AND WE HOLD EVENTS"
"AND SHARE MATERIALS, ALL"
TO HELP PEOPLE PROTECT
THEMSELVES FROM SCAMS.
>> GREAT.
SO LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT THESE SCAMS.
"DREW, WHY DO AMERICANS RECEIVE"
SO MANY OF THESE SCAM ROBOCALLS?
AND HOW CAN THEY STOP THEM?
>> TWO REALLY GOOD
"QUESTIONS, TRACY."
SO WHY SO MANY ROBOCALL SCAMS?
SCAMMERS ACTUALLY MAKE MILLIONS
OF ROBOCALLS TO U.S. PHONE
NUMBERS EVERY DAY.
"THE TRUTH IS, THEY'RE A CHEAP"
AND EASY WAY FOR SCAMMERS TO
REACH ALL OF US.
AND WHAT'S REALLY FRUSTRATING
"FOR SO MANY PEOPLE, IS THAT THE"
CALLS CAN SOMETIMES LOOK
SO LEGIT.
SCAMMERS CAN FAKE THE NAME AND
"NUMBER THAT SHOWS UP, SO IT"
"LOOKS LIKE, YOU KNOW, IT'S"
"COMING FROM A GOVERNMENT AGENCY,"
SAY THE SOCIAL SECURITY
"ADMINISTRATION, OR FROM A LOCAL"
PHONE NUMBER.
"BUT REALLY, IT'S JUST SCAMMERS"
CALLING OVER A COMPUTER SO YOU
REALLY CAN'T TRUST YOUR
CALLER ID.
"SCAMMERS, THEY DON'T CARE IF YOU"
ARE ON THE NATIONAL DO NOT CALL
REGISTRY.
YOUR BEST DEFENSE AGAINST
UNWANTED CALLS IS CALL BLOCKING.
THE WAY YOU BLOCK OR LABEL CALLS
IS GOING TO DEPEND
ON YOUR PHONE.
THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS TO
"BLOCK FOR MOBILE, TRADITIONAL"
"LAND LINE, OR A HOME PHONE THAT"
MAKES CALLS OVER THE INTERNET.
AND I HAVE TWO RESOURCES
TO SHARE.
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR MORE INFO
"ON HOW TO BLOCK CALLS, GO TO"
FTC.GOV/CALLS.
"AND IF YOU SPOT A SCAM, WHETHER"
"IT'S A ROBOCALL OR NOT, REPORT"
IT AT REPORTFRAUD.FTC.GOV.
ONE OF THE BEST WAYS YOU CAN
HELP US FIGHT FRAUD IS TO TELL
US AND TO TELL OTHERS IN YOUR
COMMUNITY.
>> THAT'S GREAT.
THANK YOU FOR THAT.
I WANT TO FOLLOW UP
ON ONE POINT.
"MY OFFICE, THE OFFICE OF THE"
"INSPECTOR GENERAL, HAS WORKED"
WITH SOCIAL SECURITY AND
TELEPHONE COMPANIES TO STOP
THOSE REAL SOCIAL SECURITY
NUMBERS FROM SHOWING
UP ON CALLER ID WHEN
SCAMMERS USE THEM.
"BUT NO METHOD IS FOOLPROOF, SO"
THANK YOU FOR THAT ADVICE TO NOT
TRUST CALLER ID.
"SO DREW, CAN YOU TELL US, HOW"
DOES A GOVERNMENT IMPOSTER
PHONE SCAM WORK?
">> SURE, TRACY."
"LIKE WITH THOSE CALLS, SCAMMERS"
WANT TO SEEM OFFICIAL.
SO THEY'LL SOMETIMES PRETEND TO
BE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO GET
YOU TO SEND THEM MONEY OR TO GET
YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.
THEY MAY THREATEN YOU WITH
ARREST OR A LAWSUIT IF YOU DON'T
"PAY A SUPPOSED DEBT, OR THEY MAY"
PROMISE LOTTERY WINNINGS IF YOU
PAY TAXES OR SOME OTHER FEES.
"AS YOU MENTIONED EARLIER, SOCIAL"
SECURITY SCAMS HAVE BEEN THE TOP
GOVERNMENT IMPOSTER SCAMS FOR
THE PAST FEW YEARS.
MANY OF US HAVE GOTTEN CALLS
FROM SOMEONE SAYING YOUR SOCIAL
SECURITY NUMBER HAS BEEN
SUSPENDED OR THAT IT HAS BEEN
INVOLVED IN A CRIME.
THEY MAY THREATEN TO ARREST YOU
OR BRING A LEGAL ACTION
AGAINST YOU.
THEY DO THIS TO SCARE YOU INTO
ACTING QUICKLY.
AND SO YOU'LL SEND MONEY OR
SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.
THEY'LL OFTEN TELL YOU TO PAY IN
"A PARTICULAR WAY TOO, OFTEN BY"
"GIFT CARD, MONEY TRANSFER,"
"MAIL-IN CASH, OR EVEN"
CRYPTOCURRENCY.
NO MATTER WHAT THE STORY THE
SCAMMERS TRY TO GET YOU TO
"BELIEVE, THE GOAL IS ALWAYS THE"
SAME: TO GET YOU TO SEND THEM
MONEY OR TO GET YOUR PERSONAL
INFORMATION.
HERE'S A TIP THAT CAN PROTECT
YOU AND YOUR LOVED
ONES FROM SCAMS.
NOBODY LEGITIMATE WILL EVER TELL
"YOU TO WIRE MONEY, BUY GIFT"
"CARDS, OR PAY WITH"
CRYPTOCURRENCY.
A LEGITIMATE BUSINESS WON'T ASK
"YOU TO PAY THAT WAY, AND"
CERTAINLY NEVER THE GOVERNMENT.
"SO IF ANYONE DOES, YOU KNOW"
IT'S A SCAM.
"OH, AND YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY"
NUMBER WON'T EVER GET
"SUSPENDED, EVER."
TAKE A LOOK AT THE GRAPHIC
ON THE SCREEN.
THIS IS JUST A VISUAL TO SHOW
YOU THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM.
"IN 2020, THE FTC RECEIVED CLOSE"
"TO 180,000 REPORTS OF GOVERNMENT"
IMPOSTER SCAMS.
OF THE PEOPLE WHO REPORTED THAT
"THEY LOST MONEY, THE MEDIAN WAS"
"AROUND $1,250."
THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT LOSS.
AND WE KNOW NOT EVERYONE
"REPORTS, SO THE PROBLEM IS"
MUCH LARGER.
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO
RECOGNIZE THE SIGNS OF AN
"IMPOSTER SCAM, AVOID IT, REPORT"
"IT, AND TELL YOUR FRIENDS"
AND FAMILY.
"AND AGAIN, YOU CAN REPORT AT"
REPORTFRAUD.FTC.GOV.
>> THAT'S A GREAT POINT.
"SOCIAL SECURITY, JUST TO"
"REITERATE, DOES NOT"
SUSPEND NUMBERS.
IF THERE'S EVER A PROBLEM WITH
"YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY ACCOUNT, OR"
"YOUR BENEFITS, THE AGENCY IS"
GOING TO MAIL YOU A LETTER.
SO IF YOU GET A CALL OUT OF THE
BLUE ABOUT A PROBLEM YOU DON'T
"RECOGNIZE, IT'S A SCAM."
JUST HANG UP.
"IF YOU'RE JUST JOINING US, WE'RE"
TALKING WITH DREW JOHNSON.
HE'S THE CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE
DIVISION OF CONSUMER AND
BUSINESS EDUCATION AT THE
FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION.
WE'RE TALKING GOVERNMENT
IMPOSTER SCAMS AND HOW YOU CAN
IDENTIFY AND AVOID THEM.
FEEL FREE TO DROP A QUESTION IN
"THE COMMENTS SECTION BELOW, BUT"
REMEMBER NOT TO POST PERSONALLY
IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION HERE OR
ON ANY SOCIAL MEDIA.
"SO DREW, I THINK MOST OF US HAVE"
RECEIVED THESE SCAM CALLS
AT THIS POINT.
THEY ARE SO COMMON.
ARE OLDER ADULTS TARGETED MORE
"FOR THESE SCAMS, OR DO THEY"
EXPERIENCE THEM MORE OFTEN THAN
OTHER AGE GROUPS?
>> EVERYONE IS TARGETED
FOR SCAMS.
AND THE FTC DATA SHOWS THAT ALL
OF US CAN FALL FOR THEM.
"IN FACT, GOVERNMENT IMPOSTER"
SCAMS ARE ONE OF THE TOP SCAMS
"REPORTED BY FOLKS OF ALL AGES,"
FROM TWENTY-SOMETHINGS TO PEOPLE
IN THEIR 80s.
ONE IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE THAT WE
SEE IN THE NUMBERS IS THAT WHEN
"THERE ARE LOSSES, OLDER PEOPLE"
TEND TO LOSE MORE.
AND THAT'S A BIG DEAL TO LOSE A
LARGE CHUNK OF MONEY IF YOU'RE
RETIRED OR CLOSE TO IT.
THERE'S JUST LESS OF A CHANCE OF
MAKING THAT MONEY BACK WHEN
YOU'RE IN YOUR 70s OR 80s.
BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT OLDER
PEOPLE ARE LOSING MONEY MORE
OFTEN THAN YOUNGER PEOPLE.
THE IMPORTANT MESSAGE HERE IS
THAT SCAMMERS ARE GOING AFTER
ALL OF US AND NO ONE IS
IMMUNE TO SCAMS.
ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO PROTECT
YOURSELF AGAINST SCAMS IS TO
"TALK ABOUT IT, SHARE YOUR"
EXPERIENCES WITH FRIENDS
AND FAMILY.
AND WE HAVE SOME REALLY GREAT
TIPS ON HOW TO START THOSE
CONVERSATIONS AT
FTC.GOV/PASSITON.
>> THAT'S GREAT.
THANK YOU.
"AND I WOULD ADD, IF YOU HAVE"
"LOST MONEY TO A SCAMMER, DON'T"
KEEP IT TO YOURSELF.
"REPORT IT TO YOUR LOCAL POLICE,"
THE FTC AT REPORTFRAUD.FTC.GOV.
"AND WE AT SOCIAL SECURITY, AS"
"OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL,"
WE HAVE A DEDICATED ONLINE FORM
FOR JUST SOCIAL SECURITY
RELATED SCAM CALLS.
AND THAT'S AT OIG.SSA.GOV.
"SO DREW, HOW CAN OUR AUDIENCE"
PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM SCAMS?
>> ANOTHER GOOD QUESTION.
SO THERE ARE A FEW EASY STEPS
THAT WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT
AND YOU CAN FIND THEM ALL AT
FTC.GOV/SCAMS.
"FIRST, BLOCK UNWANTED CALLS AND"
TEXT MESSAGES.
THAT WAY YOU DON'T SEE THOSE
SCAMS IN THE FIRST PLACE.
START AT FTC.GOV/CALLS.
"SECOND, NEVER GIVE YOUR PERSONAL"
INFORMATION OR FINANCIAL
INFORMATION OUT IN RESPONSE TO A
REQUEST THAT YOU DIDN'T EXPECT.
"NOBODY LEGIT WILL EVER CALL,"
"EMAIL, TEXT, OR ASK FOR YOUR"
INFORMATION LIKE YOUR SOCIAL
"SECURITY NUMBER, YOUR BANK"
"ACCOUNT NUMBERS, YOUR CREDIT"
"CARD NUMBERS, AND DEFINITELY"
DON'T CLICK ON THE LINKS THAT
THEY PUT IN EMAILS OR TEXT
MESSAGES.
"THIRD, RESIST THE PRESSURE TO"
ACT IMMEDIATELY.
LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES
WILL GIVE YOU TIME TO MAKE A
DECISION.
ANYONE WHO PRESSURES YOU TO PAY
OR TO GIVE YOUR PERSONAL
INFORMATION IS A SCAMMER.
"FOURTH, REMEMBER HOW SCAMMERS"
TELL YOU TO PAY.
ONLY SCAMMERS WILL INSIST THAT
"YOU PAY WITH A GIFT CARD, MONEY"
"TRANSFER, CASH, OR A"
CRYPTOCURRENCY.
AND NEVER DEPOSIT A CHECK OR
SEND MONEY BACK TO SOMEONE.
THAT'S ANOTHER SIGN OF A SCAM.
"FINALLY, STOP AND TALK WITH"
SOMEONE YOU TRUST.
IT BUYS YOU SOME TIME AND YOU
MIGHT REALIZE THAT IT'S A SCAM.
"AND, OF COURSE, TELL THE FTC AT"
REPORTFRAUD.FTC.GOV.
>> AND WHAT SHOULD SOMEONE DO IF
THEY ALREADY GAVE THEIR PERSONAL
INFORMATION TO A SCAMMER?
>> SURE.
IF YOU'VE ALREADY SHARED YOUR
"PERSONAL INFORMATION, YOUR"
"SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER, CREDIT"
"CARD NUMBER, BANK ACCOUNT"
"NUMBER, VISIT IDENTITYTHEFT.GOV"
TO REPORT IDENTITY THEFT AND GET
A PERSONALIZED RECOVERY PLAN.
YOU'LL GET DETAILED ADVICE ON
HOW TO FIX YOUR PROBLEMS CAUSED
BY IDENTITY THEFT.
YOU'LL ALSO GET A PERSONALIZED
RECOVERY PLAN THAT WALKS YOU
"THROUGH EACH STEP TO TAKE, AND"
GET PRE-FILLED LETTERS AND FORMS
"TO SEND TO CREDIT BUREAUS,"
"BUSINESSES, AND DEBT COLLECTORS."
NO MATTER WHAT TYPE OF IDENTITY
"THEFT YOU'VE EXPERIENCED, YOU'LL"
FIND OUT WHAT TO DO RIGHT AWAY.
"SO AGAIN, START AT"
IDENTITYTHEFT.GOV.
">> UNFORTUNATELY, IT LOOKS LIKE"
WE'VE RUN OUT OF TIME.
"THANK YOU, DREW, FOR JOINING US"
TODAY TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO
PROTECT YOURSELF FROM
SCAMS AND FRAUD.
"AND REMEMBER, SOCIAL SECURITY"
DOES NOT SUSPEND SOCIAL
SECURITY NUMBERS.
IF YOU OWE MONEY TO SOCIAL
"SECURITY, THEY WILL SEND YOU A"
LETTER IN THE MAIL.
BLOCK SCAM CALLS BEFORE
YOU GET THEM.
START AT FTC.GOV/CALLS AND DON'T
TRUST CALLER ID.
"IF YOU GET A SUSPICIOUS CALL,"
JUST HANG UP.
PLEASE BE SURE TO SHARE
THIS VIDEO WITH YOUR
FAMILY AND FRIENDS.

[ MUSIC PLAYING ]
have you been hit by the Telstra big
pond internet home broadband
disconnection phone calls gab this is my
story how I was almost conned Addison
cash on Wednesday the 23rd of April of
2014
my wife received a phone call from a
woman claiming that she was from Telstra
beep Colin technical support she said to
my wife that there was an issue with our
internet that it was being caused from
our computer my wife said hang on I will
pass you to my husband as he looks after
that so she headed the phone to me when
I answered the phone I had a man talking
to me not a woman I am the time did not
know my wife was speaking to a woman she
said it is touch struck the man claimed
that he was the technician from Telstra
support speaking with an Indian sounding
accent he sounded like he knew what he
was on about but I had some trouble
understanding him adieu to the accent he
was going on about that my computer was
infected with dangerous viruses and they
were causing an issue with Telstra's
internet and they would be disconnecting
my internet I asked how is this possible
I have two different antivirus
protection software's on my computer at
that point the so called technician said
I will pass you on to my supervisor I
then spoke to a man that I could
understand a bit better
he spoke with a similar accent he said
would you hold down the windows key next
to the control key on the far left of
your keyboard and also hold down the arm
litter this brought up the run function
then he asked me to type in ii-v ii-v
ii-v wo r into the open field and hit ok
this opened up the Event Viewer on my PC
he then asked me to double click on the
file name that I could not find and I
said it is not there he then asked me
is the filename under event view of
local I said application yes he said
took on that one so I double clicked on
engine and you opened up with all these
lines with information at the start of
each one he said do you see the lines of
texts that show information that is
what's causing the problem they are the
harmful viruses I must say I've never
opened the Event Viewer and had no idea
what these files were then he said hold
down the windows and the R key again to
bring up the run function and type in
WWI mmm while I calm and click ok this
opened up my browser to the website a mm
double Y which is a remote desktop
software now he said download the
software and save the file and then
double click to run it then he asked for
the ID number this was a bad mistake on
my behalf as a gaining access to my
computer he then showed me that the
information files inside the Event
Viewer whether viruses that they needed
to be cleaned up he then said we have
the software that you need to fix it and
it will cost you 25 dollars
I said well can you charge it to my big
pond account but no he said you will
have to pay us directly I then said how
do I know you are from Telstra can you
email me proof of where you were from he
opened up my web browser to Western
Union Australia and said to make the
payment so he could fix the problem with
the software I said can you give me your
details name phone number reference
number to the issue etc so he said his
name was Brandon Smith gave me a phone
number and that they were in South
Melbourne as well as a reference number
all the BS 3 5 6 2
okay I see I will call you back can you
hang up as by this time the alarm bells
were ringing this was a scam so I cut
him off and disconnected the remote
exits before anything else could take
place and then ring beep on technical
support to see if this was a scam or not
after some time waiting for the
technicians to answer a big pond I got
through and they said we do not contact
our customers with cutting off their
internet also we only ring a customer's
back if they have an outstanding
internet issue if we do need to remote
access to your computer we use our own
software called log me in that was great
to hear and that there was no issues
with my connection after this I ran my
antivirus softwares just in case there
was something they had had uploaded or
changed on my computer so the best thing
you can do if you get one of these calls
is not to give them remote access to
your computer and don't divulge any
personal or bank account details also
report the incident to Telstra and let
scam watch gov dot a you know about it -
feel free to leave your thoughts on my
experience maybe it has happened to you
do leave a comment like hit the thumbs
up and definitely share this video with
family and friends I would not like to
hear that some poor soul was scammed the
same way and this information could have
made the difference so let as many
people know about this story and thank

this past week i've been searching far
and wide all over youtube to find
certain youtubers that are just
horrible they scam people and it's not
even just random people
they scam their fans we're gonna talk
about a lot of different scams that
happen on youtube
some of these scams happened a long time
ago and some of these scams are
happening
right now this is going to be a fun and
juicy video
filled with a lot of youtubers and a lot
of scams
you're going to be glad you decided to
watch this welcome to
me talking about some popular youtubers
who literally scam their fans for no
reason part 3 or something i don't
really know
you can help me clean up youtube by
subscribing to my channel plus i'm
trying to get to 1 million subscribers
so help a brother out
also follow me on instagram or twitter
if you want to talk to me or give me any
video ideas
there are scams going on around you at
all times and you might not even realize
it but
it's actually pretty common let's say
you click on a youtube video
and the video starts like this click the
like button and comment down below for a
chance to be entered
in my free gift card giveaway i'm sorry
to everybody who wants gift cards but
yeah that's not real that's a scam and
that's just a very basic scam that
youtubers do though
those type of youtubers take advantage
of the kids that watch them
and force them into liking and
commenting on the videos
scams happen in real life too i mean not
even just on youtube have you ever got
called by a random number telling you
that you're eligible to win a prize or
that you need to pay money for this
random thing
yeah that's a scam too but this video
will be focused on youtube scams
and the scams we're going to talk about
in this video are about real things
people who watch their favorite
youtubers ended up getting scammed for
their money
credit card information addresses real
names
things like that and it's just really
horrible and it's not even just adults
kids are getting scammed by their
favorite youtubers too
we're gonna talk about all of that let's
meet our first scammer
kayla massa was a 22 year old youtuber
who had over 100
000 subscribers on her youtube channel
and over 300
000 followers on instagram she had a
load of followers and so many
subscribers so
you would expect people to like her and
i assume
most people would trust her right well
no i'm wrong
looking at her channel everything looks
normal nothing really looks weird here i
mean she posted challenges like the bean
boozled challenge
the whisper challenge as well as q and
a's and stuff like that
everyone did that back in the day like
four years ago on youtube so what's so
special about her though
the weird thing is she hasn't posted in
four whole months
where did she go and what happened to
her
let's dive way deeper into this one day
a while back she decided to post on her
instagram story
and she wanted to give her fans a little
present
she told her followers that they could
earn up to seven thousand dollars
instantly by giving her access to their
bank account
now hold up she said what if you have a
bank account and you're interested in
making money hit me up
this is sketchy really sketchy who the
heck would give up their bank
information
to this random girl but remember she had
300 000 followers so she had to be legit
right
i mean i only have 13 000 followers on
instagram but i have 900
000 subs on youtube what the heck is up
with that why can she get more followers
than me
you guys have to help me with that link
in the description but anyways
a lot of people thought she was legit
because she had so many followers so
her fans decided to believe her and give
up their bank accounts that were full
of their life savings at first though
everything was going good
she told them that she was gonna add in
some money to their account and she did
but then she started to go ahead and
spend all their money
on random things imagine doing that to
your fans
that is so bad here's a story from one
of her fans that she
actually scammed and guess what it was a
kid
we will refer to the kid as donald so
donald saw her instagram story he then
decided to listen to her
because she had over 300 000 followers
and donald trusted her
he trusted her with his money and he
expected to make seven thousand dollars
that would be a lot of money for
somebody young like him the next day
kayla met donald at a coffee shop and he
handed over his debit cards credit cards
pin numbers
pretty much everything else handed it
right over to her
after a few weeks everything was good
but then eventually
she started spending thousands of
dollars that he had but he couldn't do
anything about it because it was his
account
she was never really found guilty
because nobody could prove that she did
it
she would always delete the messages and
end up blocking the person
until february 13th she got what she
deserved
federal authorities in new jersey
arrested and charged kayla following a
complaint that found her guilty
of illegally scamming listen to this
listen to this over
45 of her followers many of who
were under 18 years old scamming your
fans of two million dollars
i can't believe that a youtuber who
worked so hard to get to a hundred
thousand subscribers
started to scam the people who made her
relevant
they subscribed to her they followed her
and she ended up scamming them
and don't forget that she scammed so
many people that were under 18 years old
she scammed 45 people and around 30 of
them were under 18.
what is wrong with her i would never do
that to you guys though and you guys
know that for a fact
i want to check out some of her videos
though because if she can scam her fans
for seven
thousand dollars then she must be a
psychopath type of person am i right
i want to see how she acts in her
youtube videos and i want to see if we
can spot
anything weird about her she's gonna
pick me up at twelve zero zero
so mind you is around 10 something
because you know homecoming ends at 10
so it was like 10 30 11.
yeah 10 30 is 11. mind you my mom is
going to pick me up at 12.00 so what was
i thinking i couldn't find much but it
seemed
kind of weird when i was watching a q a
video by her her sister was telling a
story
and she did not care at all like she's
making a youtube video
but she's staring at her phone you know
what she was probably scamming her fans
right there i couldn't really find
anything else that seemed weird about
her
her channel link is actually in the
description if you can find anything
weird about her
in her videos you should send me a tweet
or tag me in something on instagram
because i read all of my comments and
stuff
on instagram and twitter so i'm curious
to see what you guys can find and see if
we can prove that she was weird this
whole time
so i'm in the process of making this
video right i'm trying to find some
scammers
and i randomly see on my youtube home
screen a video that says
top 5 biggest youtube scams that got
exposed now i didn't think too much of
it
i thought it was perfect timing so i
clicked on the video and i wanted to try
to find some inspiration
and then something weird happened just a
quick reminder if you want to enter our
free amazon gift card giveaway just hit
the subscribe button and leave a comment
down below tell me which spot is your
favorite and why also let's see if we
can smash 10
000 likes on this video if we can do
that i will personally deliver each and
every person who likes this video in
iphone 7.
that is so ironic in his video he's
talking about people who got exposed for
scamming on youtube
but he's literally doing fake giveaways
i don't know if he was joking or if he's
actually serious but if he was being
serious then that's hilarious he's
talking about scammers
when he's scamming people right there
now there's this one common
scam that i see on a lot of different
youtube videos and it's not really a
scam
it's just a horrible way to get likes
and subscribers and i'm sure you've seen
it and heard it before
you click on a youtube video and then
they say like this video or a spider
will be in your bed tonight
you don't want to risk it i don't
understand how anybody falls for that
because obviously if you like the video
it won't change the fact that there's a
bug in your bed but
for some reason every single video where
they do that stupid spider stuff
they get 50 000 freaking likes on their
video but my videos over here only get
like 20 000 but
whatever of course we can't forget about
the dumbest
one of all make sure you like and
subscribe to the channel let's measure
our 5 000 likes yeah
if we smash that million likes that
means you'll have a girlfriend by
next week so yeah make sure to do that
this was in one of my old videos and i
can't get enough of it the dude said
uh like the video and uh you'll have a
girlfriend
next week yeah like the video like that
is so stupid
let's talk about another scam the world
of youtube gaming scams
is just huge people scam other people
for items
in their favorite video games and i know
all you guys might be thinking oh that's
not even that weird it's just you know
taking items from people but people are
scamming people for things that are
worth real money
and for things that people worked hard
for or spent real money on
i made a video on fortnight scammers
before and basically to sum it up
people act like they're gonna trade guns
but then they just steal their guns and
these guns have
real life value there are so many other
games where people scam their fans i
mean go ahead and think of a game like
rocket league if you search up rocket
league scamming
you'll find so many videos of people
just recording themselves
scamming people you can almost search up
any game and you'll find some type of
people scamming
and it's not always the popular
youtubers doing this there are youtubers
with only 100 subscribers doing the same
thing
scamming people i feel like this has to
be stopped i mean youtube will literally
allow a video to be
uploaded that says how to scam in rocket
league but they delete other random
videos
now there are actually bots that act
like the youtubers
and then end up stealing money from
their fans
let's say it's a normal day and you see
a video by
ali a so you click on it and you start
watching it you go into the comments
and then you see a comment that says i
have a gift for my fans click here
you see that the comment was posted by
ali a but in reality
people made a fake account with the same
name as a youtuber
the comment is usually like in a weird
font and it's misspelled and spaced out
i don't know why they do that but it's
pretty obvious that it's a fake account
right
but once again there are kids on youtube
that don't understand that i figured out
that once the kids or just anyone click
on this link
all of their information gets exposed
the scammers that made the account get
their first name
last name address card number and things
like that just from clicking on a link
you might think uh nobody really falls
for that fake comment there's probably
a couple of people who click on it so
it's not even that bad but there was
actually a study
that in the last month over 70 000
people clicked on those links
in one month the thing is though this
has been happening since
2016. so if you go ahead and do 70 000
people who fell for it
times 12 months times 4
years that comes out to over 3 million
people who have clicked this link
now that's not a exact number but that's
a good estimate
on how many people have clicked on these
links over three million
there is one good thing about this scam
though and it's that recently i haven't
really seen too many of these accounts
so maybe youtube is doing something
about it
a couple of years back there was a scam
that went around youtube that everybody
hated
it involved ricegum jake paul t martin
syndicate
and more of your favorite youtubers all
those guys are super popular
i'm sure you guys have already heard
about it but it was super scummy and i
want to relive this
so this was back when all those case
opening sites were super popular
basically
you go to a website you pay money to
open up a virtual box
and stuff like that and you had a chance
of getting something really expensive
and you could make your money back but
it was basically gambling ricegum and
jake paul made videos about these type
of sites
and they showed them in their videos
winning big money and saying
oh my god guys it's super easy to win
money on this site
you can get awesome stuff just go to the
website well
actually ricegum and jake paul connected
with the people who
owned those websites and got juiced
accounts what i mean by that i don't
mean like orange juice
the people who own the website were
juicing up their accounts
making them win way more than any of
their fans would
so jake paul ricegum people like that
acted like it was super easy to win
but in reality it's super hard to win
and don't even get me started about the
fact that most of their fans are little
kids who aren't legally allowed to
gamble so they were promoting gambling
to little kids t martin and syndicate's
scam situation was a little
different though they made videos on a
website called cs go lotto and you would
play gambling games
for the game cs go you know you would
open up cases and stuff for gun skins
and different things like that
t martin and syndicate kept stressing
how they kept winning and it was super
easy to win
the thing is though both of them owned
the website so they could rig it to make
them win whenever they wanted so
basically
the same thing happened as ricegum and
jake paul situation but these guys
actually own the website
all these youtubers eventually moved on
from this and they're not doing these
type of things anymore so that's super
good
so what can we do about all of this i
hope youtube actually sees this video
and sees how many people are still
scamming in 2020 and how many people are
getting away with it
i doubt they'd do anything about the
people saying like the video enjoy my
giveaway or like the video and the
spider is going to get you
because they can't really prove if
that's real or not but
maybe just maybe they can get rid of the
people who literally scam people
through those fake comments and get rid
of those people who record themselves
scamming people on video games maybe one
day youtube will realize how many scams
are going on in the world of youtube
and hopefully they will start to clean
it up you can click on any of the videos
on screen to watch another video
where we go ahead and expose some of the
worst youtubers
on this platform and if you haven't
subscribed to my channel yet what are
you doing like honestly
what are you doing but yeah watch

most ridiculous scam bait

we were part of it so it was absolutely
crazy
all in all on the counter on the timer
it hit
10 hours but we were talking to multiple
scammers
they were calling us many many many
times so it was
well over 11 maybe 12 or even more
hours of actual scammer time being
wasted
and it was absolutely insane the entire
call
so what you are about to see what you
are about to embark on is
part one of the mini-series of this
10-hour call
and all of the ridiculousness with it
so here you go and enjoy i don't
want it i want to cancel it oh shame are

order on the thing and
and the ebays you know normally we use
the amazons because that's so much
better and somebody said hey
check out the ebays but the ebays i
don't like it i don't like it because
i don't know who it is i know jeff bezos
you know he's trying to go into space
and everything it's pretty cool
hey did you see that other guy two by
the way earlier he was going into space
what was his name oh my god oh my
goodness from virgin galactic or
whatever it is it's it's uh
oh oh it was a dick bronzona that's
it that's awesome yeah thanks squam
thanks yeah he went into space that was
pretty cool
um but yeah so i was trying to get the
philippe jewish she ordered it so that's
why she was calling because something
happened so
but yeah if we could get this taken care
of that would be wonderful because when
we ordered it
it wasn't what we ordered it was
something else it was called fob juice
okay i'll be taking care of it
i can i can tell you one thing that i
think that
uh her account is being
accessed by someone else as well with
the name of david cooper
david oh my god the name of david cooper
no but do you know who it is david
cooper george
i don't know yeah who who is this you do
you know who that is
and do you know where they live i'll go
pay him a visit right now
this person is living from i mean i mean
the location which is coming is
vancouver canada oh i'm going to take a
drive up there
it's trying to this person is
trying to place a lot of orders
and we are finding something suspicious
on this account and
that's why we have blocked the orders
you don't know anyone no no
i don't know that i mean i i don't
really know anybody in canada
who's in canada honey i don't know
some some guy who's using your account
this guy said there's some fraudulent
activity
someone's using my account yeah
yeah we're going to try and get it fixed
okay
yeah so so what do we got to do what do
we got to do i mean that's not good
especially since she's an older woman
you know her time is his time is
precious
right now what kind of phone what kind
of phone is she using is it an iphone or
and then
uh she she got one of those that plug
into the wall
it's got a little kitty cat it get the
eyes go back and forth
and then the tail goes click click click
click click
she don't have you you mean cell phone
she don't have a cell phone
oh yes dolphy gave me her
old android phone i do have a phone
oh grams you got a phone oh i thought
that i thought that person
gave me i thought yeah it was trying to
get you
gave me her cell phone when she went off
to college
i don't know for all the only glands
account that i've been selling my feet
pictures
uh oh okay that makes sense because i
got the the email
i got the facebook request and i thought
it was from somebody who was trying to
impersonate you but it wasn't you
i was gonna talk to you about that today
that you didn't accept my friend to
request well i didn't know he was on the
facebook
i thought you were about i thought you
were there because i was ordering all
the foot lube
for my holy grail that makes sense it's
okay because yeah
anything else other than all that lube
yeah that makes sense because the feet
were it was your profile picture
hey oh i'm sorry oh my god grams we
forgot he was on the phone yeah he's
helping us with the ebays because he
said something's going on with your
account
cooper's on the phone you better talk to
him
eb cooper oh yeah we gotta find him
yeah so i'll tell you that it seems that
you know maybe her account has been
hacked
and uh this could be because of the
phone as well that you know maybe her
phone got hacked or something
you know how how did you order uh from
ebay
yeah so i'll tell you that probably in
this case uh her phone
uh her computer probably might have been
compromised
and i hope uh
she's not using any kind of banking and
other social media on her computer
because probably that could have been
hacked as well
oh my goodness yeah so what
do we what can we do can we get this
fixed or what
yes we can definitely get this fixed uh
i would like to know
what all applications does she uses on
her computer does she do any kind of
banking
uh hold on let me let me see grams you
do banking on the computers
oh yes dorothy junior set up everything
so i don't have to go anywhere
because you remember i had that accident
uh and it was the second one in half of
a year where i hit two people
and the judge said that if i hit another
person
that they might have to suspend my
driver's license for two weeks
so dorothy said that it's best for me to
just be able to go on the computer
to check all the money that's in my bank
account
uh but the last time i i think i had
around eleven thousand dollars in there
you want me to go
you don't you don't need to tell my mom
if someone was trying to take my money
out
that's personal information you're not
supposed to give that out bit
well it's okay if you know how much
money i have
i know how much money you got you handle
most of my finances anyway
okay yeah i know that but i didn't know
yeah do you do anything else on the
computer i know you do your your
pictures your
your feed pictures yeah
she's making like like eight thousand
dollars a month right now
and i know she's going in the home real
soon so guess who's getting all that
money
that's a lot of meatball subs i guess
i told you they try to take the reason
no
no no no you're gonna go to the doctors
yeah i'd like to tell you something that
someone uh
you know because the order which has
been placed is
is coming off one of the one of the four
banks i'm going to tell you
uh chase
what my chaser banker account is
compromised
is it is it chase that you use
i have h m chase bank yes
how did you know because because the
order which is being placed by david
cooper
is being placed through uh the chase
bank account so this could be a
possibility
is the woman stealing all my information
man it's like he is and there's
something there's something called
zell which he is using uh but don't
worry
we'll we'll go ahead and fix it up no
sir can you please go to your computer

password protection and stuff like that
you think she's gonna need something
like that and can you refer something to
us

and then and then just just again
because maybe they have a passwords and
they have some information
because she does she said she does the
banking online in that do you think that
she'd be
able to get some sort of identity theft
can you recommend any identity theft
programs that she can get into just in
case something happens like
uh somebody else is trying to access the
account or something like that because
we really don't want to get it we don't
want anybody getting a bank account

thousands of dollars after
she'd missed falling victim to
one of those online phishing
"scams. Well tonight, she's"
telling her story in hopes of
saving somebody else. FOX 13's
Josh Cascio has the story. The
reason I'm doing this interview
is to warn other people.
Belinda from Pinellas County
doesn't want anyone else in the
same boat. She is scammed out
of thousands of dollars. And
zero hope of ever getting it
"back. These people out there,"
fishing Aled the time Belinda
runs her own cleaning company.
"A couple days ago, she took a"
strange call The post on the
other end Heaven Indian accent.
And he said he was calling from
Apple. There was some alert
that should have been the first
red flag. But she says the
scammers caught her at a moment
"of mental exhaustion, and she"
"went along, he said the way to"
correct this is for me. For X
amount of money in fight buying
cards from target and despite
"another red flag, she did $5000"
worth. Months of hard work and
savings gone just like that.
Now in the hands of criminals.
That's what made more than
anything that might physical
labor. The sweat the integrity
"that I was there, I had built"
this company. They had took
that away. Scams like this one
"are sadly very common, Experts"
say. The first line of defense
is your caller. I d simply
don't answer a call. You don't
recognize. And certainly if you
"hear the words, gift cards,"
watch out. Banks are not going
to call you apples not going to
call you Amazons. Not going to
call you. None of these
reputable companies are going
to reach out by the telephone
and call you so a soon as you
hear that if you answer the
"phone, just hang up. And if"
"something seems fishy, just"
call the police first. Because
one small mistake can lead to a
big financial disaster.
Josh Cascio FOX 13 news.
"Belinda We're so sorry, police"
say in most of these cases
tracking this collar's down is
nearly impossible because
usually they're calling from
outside the United States. That

JASON KNOWLES SPEAKING TO A
WOMAN WHO LOST $1500 TO THIS
POPULAR SCHEME.
JASON: ONE WOMAN SAYS IT ALL
STARTED WITH A FAKE AMAZON
WEBSITE WHICH HAD A PHONY PHONE
NUMBER.
SHE CALLED THAT PHONE NUMBER
WHICH SOUNDED SO REAL.
THEN SHE FELL INTO THE SCAMMER''
TRAP.
QUICK THEY MADE $1500 IN 30
MINUTES.
JASON: BRENDA OLIVER HAS A
MESSAGE FOR CUSTOMERS WHO MIGHT
BE FOOLED INTO CALLING A FAKE
AMAZON NUMBER.
">> NEVER, EVER GIVE A -- GET A"
GIFT CARD AND GIVE THESE PEOPLE
THE NUMBERS OFF THE BACK.
JASON: OLIVER WAS RECENTLY
WIDOWED.
HER HUSBAND HAD AN AMAZON PRIME
"ACCOUNT SHE DID NOT USE, SO SHE"
TRIED TO CLOSE IT AND STOP THE
ANNUAL FEE.
>> I TRIED TO DO SOMETHING THAT
"WOULD HELP ME, AND IN THE END,"
THESE PEOPLE WERE SCARING ME.
JASON: HER SEARCH TURNED UP A
FAKE AMAZON WEBSITE WITH A PHONY
PHONE NUMBER.
SHE SAID THE REPRESENTATIVE ON
THAT FRAUDULENT PHONE NUMBER
TOLD HER TO SEND GIFT CARDS
BEFORE THEY COULD GET HER
HUSBAND'S ACCOUNT UP-TO-DATE.
BUT IT WAS ALL A RUSE.
SHE NEVER GOT THAT REMAINING
BALANCE BACK AND LOST $1500 IN
GIFT CARDS.
SHE DID NOT KNOW THAT BY GIVING
THE SCAMMERS THE NUMBER OFF THE
BACK OF THE GIFT CARDS THE MONEY
WAS IMMEDIATELY GONE AND
UNTRACEABLE.
>> THEY WILL SEARCH FOR A PHONE
NUMBER AND FIND ONE FROM JUST A
RANDOM WEBSITE THAT SAYS THIS IS
THE PHONE NUMBER FOR THIS
"COMPANY YOU ARE TRYING TO REACH,"
AND THAT PHONE NUMBER ROUTES TO
A BURNER PHONE.
JASON: WHICH COULD END UP BEING
AN UNTRACEABLE NUMBER.
THE I-TEAM HAS REPORTED ON FAKE
FACEBOOK AND FAKE UBER NUMBERS
WHICH HAVE ALSO RIPPED PEOPLE
OFF.
>> IF YOU GO ON GOOGLE AND TYPE
"IN AMAZON PHONE NUMBER, YOU WILL"
"FIND THE LEGITIMATE NUMBER, BUT"
THERE WILL BE A LOT OF OTHER
ONES LIFTED.
A LOT OF THESE WEBSITES POP UP
OVERNIGHT AND ARE GONE A FEW
DAYS LATER AFTER THEY HAVE TAKEN
ADVANTAGE OF A FEW PEOPLE.
JASON: ALL FILED A POLICE REPORT
AND SHOWED THEM THE FAKE AMAZON
PAGE.
"WHEN SHE CALLED THE I-TEAM, THE"
"PAGE WAS DOWN, BUT THE PHONE"
NUMBER STILL WORKED.
>> YOU ARE CALLING AMAZON

JASON: AFTER MORE THAN 20
"MINUTES ON HOLD, I HUNG UP, BUT"
I REPORTED THE SUSPICIOUS NUMBER
TO A REAL CUSTOMER SERVICE
REPRESENTATIVE AT AMAZON.
>> THIS IS NOT IN AMAZON PHONE
"NUMBER, SIR."
JASON: THE REAL AMAZON PHONE

dictation up is how about you
hi I was just returning a missed phone
call from earlier regarding a tax issue
hold on purple of the information cut
the boat leave the time speaking with
machine correct that's my first name yet
Ultima so freeing
my name is officer Stephen Casey with
the batch ID number one oh five eight
seven nine and this is the reason behind
this call is to inform you that you are
being listed as the primary suspect in a
case involving the ATO at this moment
Tod 8 your money right I would like to
give you the information on the line
which we are talking right now has
recorded and monitored by the ATO and
the local authorities of your state and
would live in performing of the truth oh
yeah okay any kind of information you
just a personal issue sorry personal
business oh okay oh good
kilometer trained at this moment the
purpose of this call is just to take
down your economy's information do you
have any criminal attorney but in all
other another I don't want a loyal and
it's a finger not a very positive
situation before no not really I get my
taxes done from a tax agent is it his

information I want to notify you that
the lines on which we are talking right
now has been recorded and monitored by
the ATO Supreme Court and the local
authorities of your territory so please
don't interrupt me while I'm speaking
and listen to me very carefully
so check okay so now as for the
affidavit the ATU has discovered strong
evidence that you happen to declare your
actual income which was higher than what
it was when she yeah you have wrongly
benefited from the reductions which you
are not eligible for this was not the
result of an innocent negligence and we
have a reason to believe that it was a
little accident with an intent to
defraud education office yes the reason
there are very serious criminal
allegations or Palelei only count one
violation of the federal tax regulation
yet come to violation of the Australian
Taxation code and countering the
deception where the ATO will mark a lien
on your personal assets including your
housing are all your known bank accounts
could be frozen and confiscated which
means the ATU will recover your tasted
from the bulk of the label in your bank
accounts you will not be able to access
your bank accounts to lepromatous true
so the credit reporting agencies would
be notified about your textbook and they
are most likely to download your credit
rating on your wages and benefits would
be frozen by informing your employer and
the government bodies and if you have an
existing payment bond with the ATO then
it would scan terminated under the
section 3 0 AF one to one of the ATO
code and your passport was deceased and
if you belong to the country other than
Australia then you run the risk of being
afforded the 80 you will get a
non-bailable arrest warrant issued
against your name now the total our
scanning capability along with the
bounty cultures 3159 dollars and the ETU
is not at all interested in taking this
money from you now machine as as soon as

sir yeah sorry you need to calm down now
it's full time for you to calm down
yeah it's hard to calm down have you
ever won 1.9 million dollars
well i'm working for the company so i
know i'm i'm holding a lot of money
right yeah i'm sorry yeah i'm sure you
are it's it's
it's crazy though listen listen yes
listen i'm gonna make this simple for
you okay
good i'm gonna make this simple for you
i need it very simple we're gonna
the reason why you got the charges for
the 500
sir it's because we are gonna take care
of the shipping and handling fee for you
so that um the delivery could be made by
a flat red record truck coming over to
you
to bring your money okay so we are
bringing
every nickel and
[Music]
yes that's what i'm trying to show you
right we're gonna we are gonna escort it
we are gonna come at your home with two
u.s smart for security purposes to
secure your money
along with our company lawyer then we
are gonna comfort you
at the comfort of your home then take it
on to your local bank of choice yeah
well
okay where we are gonna create an
account for you
which you don't have that large sum of
money being lodged
into right all right
so you're gonna bring it to me and then
help me get it to the bank
yes because that's a lot that's a lot of
nickel and dimes
so that is wow listen
1.9 million dollars in nickel and dime
that's that is so hard to believe
yes uh yes yes i'm listening
then we're gonna take you to the bank
whenever we create the icon for you and
we have great
logistics which banks we have we have
three banks in town
does it matter which bank i use no it
it doesn't matter it does you know what
i tell you what
since it's this much money can we like
go to
put a little bit in all three banks look
at that
should we do that sir sir you know i
understand that you don't want anyone to
know about your money
because
the money into that account you don't
have to go to the bank you could use
your debit card or credit card to
withdraw money
i really don't want to put 1.9 million
dollars all in one bank
can i split that up in between the other
two banks and down
well you could even keep it at your home
no one would have to know about it
you just take a money out of it and buy
a big safe you know those safe with
those right here
on it okay and you turn your money into
that would be great to have at my home
okay and you take care of your
family yeah yeah you have to keep that
confidential though wouldn't i yeah if i
had
yeah right if i had 1.9 million dollars
in my home
someone might make it look like you
should make it look like you're living a
normal life my friend just make it look
that way
yeah i might even just you know i might
not even buy a new car
i may go like buy an old car one that
barely runs
that way like i don't have anything so
listen sir
yeah listen to me um can you move all
that forward
now so it wouldn't be good to buy like
buy a lamborghini with it
well anything you want to do my friend
okay but that wouldn't be like living a
normal life would it
not really so listen people say you're
spending your money but they don't know
where it come from they can't
right you're a rich person or not if
right
they could only judge you yeah they can
judge me you know it it just
this this is so crazy you know i was
just
expecting a call like this today for
some reason i just knew that
i was going to have a good day today sir
listen to me now because
yeah it's 11 34 a.m here oh okay
almost one time i don't know what i'm
going to do for lunch
i i'm listening i haven't even decided
once you get the money in your position
you'll know what to do with it okay
okay all right okay what would you
recommend for lunch though
well what out i would buy one of those
subway you know those subway for ten
dollars those
five yeah oh my god my friend
oh my god they're like a yeah they're
only like five dollars for
january and february yes i mean
you want to do it five foot long that
would be
good i we have a subway here in our town
so i might just do that
okay so that is such a good idea i am so
glad you michael
yes i'm sorry go ahead sir are you going
to keep your business confidential
yeah i need you to not even positively
i wouldn't think of letting anyone know
about this
not even your wife no no you could be
surprised at what all i keep
from my wife she has no idea all right
okay
but please keep that confidential
because i want her to know that
i keep i keep this at confidential and
this is and this is your number right
yes yes it is telephone number right
yeah you called me on my cell phone
number yes
okay and i thought then i called you at
876
eight 817 nine right i i wrote that down
that way in case i needed to call you
back on it
yes you could even save it yes you could
write yes write it down you could even
save it in your
phone and call me anytime you think that
you wanna call me you just
call me my friend because right here
listen now what i needed to do for me
sir
someone else is trying to call me right
now but i'm not going to answer that
phone
because this is important right what i
needed to do for me now and i'd be too
excited to talk to them if i answered
the phone right now
i'd be too excited to talk to them and
they would
they would figure out something was
wrong and they said no
no yeah so you need a time to calm down
now what i needed to do for me
i need is is there a western union close
to you
western union i have no idea yeah i have
no idea we're
we're we're still kind of like a western
town we're not like
um you know really fancy rich town so i
guess we are still kind of like
western people we just don't we don't
ride horses and
carry guns like they used to do can you
find
listen can you find 700
700 oh my goodness um
well i'll tell you what i might could
like time somebody out of seven hundred
dollars
i can probably figure out a way to do
that today
how much can you find sir i don't know
you know if i can find it
i could like i don't know i'm thinking
listen can you find 500
500 it's a great possibility but what
i'll have to do
is i'll probably have to call somebody
and if i
call somebody and i and like i lie to
them
and yeah and tell them they won
something then they might give me 700
because there's people that does that
there's people that calls like these
elderly people and they and they tell
them that they won
something and then the elderly the
elderly people
don't know any better and the elderly
people just give them the money
so that is something that does die
[Music]
that's what someone told me before they
told me there's actually people that do
that kind of stuff
can you believe those those guys are
garbage stuff
that is those guys are the they're
garbage i don't believe somebody would
do that
stuff you know
today and i could give them this big
story like they want money
you know what it just i won 1.9 million
i could tell them they won 1.9 million
dollars
and if i tell them that and tell them
that i need to get a shipment to them
and the only way i can get that shipment
to them is if they give me a
um a western union wire of 700
they may be stupid enough to wear these
700
and if you're not stupid enough to wire
me seven hundred dollars
i might would be stupid enough to wire
you to seven hundred dollars
listen you're not worried me no seven
hundred dollars soon
oh i know i'm not yeah
so i'm making so sorry
sir
are you willing and receiving this prize
today sir because we want to get this
over with
and that's it and i want you to receive
this today sir
yes yeah i am so excited about this
yo fi your voice change sir yeah
it did because so far i've been on the
phone for like 21
minutes and 39 seconds okay yes because
i told you they called down a long time
ago and you never calmed up
never calmed down because you know what
i was really just had the extra time
and i was opening up a package that i
had got in the mail today
that i was actually excited about
getting
so i knew i was getting that package can
you call me about this other package
with 1.9 million dollars so i kind of
acted like i was excited
and i i recorded this phone call that
way it would be really really fun for
all my friends to hear
just how crazy of an idea this is
and just how crazy that people are if
they think that someone's going to give
them 1.9 million dollars
listen listen listen to me sir
okay your name along with your phone
number
i've been entered into a grand prize
rafa
that is how your your name is listen
and your phone is the phone's also been
recorded on this
telephone call if you happen to remember
me saying your telephone number back so
guess what when i
share this recording with all of my
friends
and they laugh about it and they realize
how stupid this
is they may just call you back and waste
your time
like you wasted mine today sir
sir how do you know that you're not
gonna get this today sir tell me
um listen i'm a little bit more aware
than maybe your last victim was
no sir no sir i'm i'm just i'm just 45
minutes away from you so nothing like
exactly
listen to me listen first off can you
listen sir please
tell me where we're at if you're 45
minutes away from me tell me where
you're at
barton where are you at that's 45
minutes away from me
if i'm 45 minutes away from you right
where is that at
well definitely sir we are on the
highway
on the highway the freeway you're on a
freeway that's 45 minutes away from me
yes okay so where would that freeway be
are you in arkansas
yes sir are you in missouri
i'm in arkansas in arkansas so you're
saying there's a three-way within 45
minutes from me in arkansas
no we're just taking a shortcut so we're
going to reject
it right right can can you tell me what
the closing the nearest city is to you
right now
so listen sir right so you tell me what
the nearest city do you use right now
sir sir listen to me you don't want this
package i could see that um
i'm gonna have it i'm gonna have this
package being delayed because
right now it'll be okay why don't you
give it someone else
that someone else i'm sure i am positive
that you will probably figure out
someone else that you can con out of 700
just so they can get their 1.99 i do
listen listen i didn't say you were to
send seven hundred dollars so
yeah what are you gonna do listen what
are you gonna do you're gonna take
at least 500 and you're gonna get a
green that money pack scratch card
that's what you're gonna do
all right michael this has been a lot of
fun my friends
are probably gonna really really like
this call if they make it to the 25
minute mark um so but they're gonna like
the first few minutes of the fall at
least
so i'll tell you what um it's been
really really nice talking to you thanks
for
um you know trying to con me out of my
money today
but you did make the day a little bit
funner so um

"TONIGHT, 8 ON YOUR SIDE"
INVESTIGATES A DANGEROUS DATING
GAME.
SHANNON BEHNKEN JOINING US WITH
THE TROUBLING TWIST ON AN OLD
INTERNET SCAM.
Reporter: HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE
HAVE FALLEN VICTIM TO THIS BUT
THEY ARE SO EMBARRASSED THEY
ARE AFRAID TO EVEN TELL ANYBODY
ABOUT IT.
THE MAN YOU ARE ABOUT TO MEET
DOESN'T WANT HIS FACE SHONE.
WE ARE GOING TO CALL HIM RUSTY.
HE IS STEPPING FORWARD TO WARN
YOU WANT TO TAKE POWER AWAY
FROM THESE SCAMMERS.
WE ALL CRAVE A CONNECTION.
RUSTY TURNED TO THE WEBSITE
"PLENTY OF FISH, ENCOURAGED BY"
FRIENDS.
HE DIPPED HIS TOE INTO THE POND
AND MET A 27-YEAR-OLD WOMAN.
THEY TEXTED.
IT WAS EXCITING.
AT SOME POINT SHE STARTS TO
SEND ME SOME REVEALING PICTURES.
SHE ASKED ME FOR THE SAME IN
RETURN.
"Reporter: HE PLAYED ALONG,"
SENDING PICTURES HE NOW REGRETS.
AND THEN:
SHE SAID SOMETHING LIKE ARE
YOU READY TO DO SO I'M SO TO
THIS 17-YEAR-OLD BODY?
AND IMMEDIATELY I RESPONDED 17?
Reporter: THAN A SURPRISE
"CALL, TAMPA POLICE, SUSPICIOUS,"
RESIG GOOGLED THE NUMBER AND IT
SHOWED IT WAS POLICE.
HE READ OFF LIKE THREE
DIFFERENT FELONY COUNTS AND
THREATENED ME WITH UP TO I
THINK LIKE 25 YEARS IN PRISON.
Reporter: THAT MUST HAVE
BEEN A SCARY PHONE CALL.
IT WAS.
IT PROBABLY LITERALLY TOOK
YEARS OF MY LIFE.
Reporter: AND THEN THE
GIRL'S FATHER WANTED TO TALK.
HE SAID WE WILL PUT WARRANT
OUT AND COME AND GET YOU.
Reporter: IN A MOMENT ARE
YOU THINKING I COULD GO TO
JAIL?
ABSOLUTELY.
Reporter: THE DAD SOUNDED
LEGIT UNTIL HE IMPLIED MONEY
MIGHT MAKE THE NIGHTMARE GO
AWAY.
RUSTY FRANTICALLY SEARCHED THE
WEB AND REALIZED HE WASN'T
ALONE.
IT WAS A SCAM.
SOMETIMES THEY WOULD ASK FOR
MONEY RIGHT AWAY.
"SOMETIMES, THEY WOULD WAIT A"
COUPLE OF DAYS TO MAKE YOU
WORRY.
Reporter: I FOUND CHANGING
YOUR NUMBER IS EASY.
THERE ARE MANY OTHER APPS --
"MANY APPS FOR THAT, EVEN TO"
MAKE YOUR NUMBER SHOW UP AS
LOCAL POLICE.
I WANT YOU TO HEAR SOME OF THE
MESSAGES MEN HAVE RECEIVED LEFT
ON DAILY SCAM.COM.
MY NAME IS TO PERRY.
I'M AN INVESTIGATOR IN
"GREENVILLE, SOUTH CAROLINA."
I AM WITH INDIANAPOLIS
POLICE DEPARTMENT.
Reporter: EVEN TAMPA POLICE
STUNNED BY THE SOPHISTICATION.
THERE IS MANY LAYERS SO EVEN
AFTER YOU ARE SKEPTICAL AFTER
"THE FIRST LAYER, YOU MIGHT"
THINK THIS IS REALLY GETTING TO
BE A BIG PROBLEM.
Reporter: THIS SCHEME IS BIG
BUSINESS.
THEY HAVE PEOPLE FULFILLING
DIFFERENT ROLES.
SOMEONE IS FINDING NEW TARGETS.
ANOTHER PERSON IS DOING THESE
FOLLOW-UP CALLS TO TRY TO SCARE
THEM.
Reporter: TAKE IT FROM
RUSTY.
EVEN THOUGH THESE THREATS
"AREN'T REAL, THE FEAR IS."
TO BE INNOCENT AND HAVE THAT
FEELING IS HORRIBLE.
Reporter: AND THE END GAME
HERE IS TO GET MORE MONEY.
THE CROOKS STATES NEEDED TO PAY
FOR THINGS LIKE THERAPY FOR
THEIR DAUGHTER OR JUST TO HOLD
THE VICTIM ACCOUNTABLE AND WHEN
"YOU DO GIVE MONEY, YOU CAN"
IMAGINE THEY TEND TO ASK FOR
MORE HOLDING THE THREAT OF
ARREST OVER YOUR HEAD.
HOW MUCH ARE WE TALKING
ABOUT?
OF $2000 AND SOME PEOPLE SAY
THEY COME BACK AFTERWARD.
HOW CAN YOU KNOW THE PERSON
YOU'RE TALKING TO IS SOMEONE
YOU CAN TRUST?
A LOT OF PEOPLE GO TO THESE
WEBSITES.
IT'S THE MODERN WAY TO DATE.
MANY PEOPLE HAVE FOUND THEIR
SPOUSE THAT WAY BUT YOU HAVE TO
BE REALLY CAREFUL.
THE BIG TAKE AWAY HERE IS BE
CAREFUL WITH SENDING
PHOTOGRAPHS.
that's not just bad that's criminal
you're about to witness the worst
product to have ever graced humanity
but for some reason people are buying it
and people are raving about it
so the other day i was browsing for the
best smartphone gadgets of the month
and i came across this peculiar device
mobile phone and wi-fi
radiation harmonizer and i was not
expecting the journey that this was
about to take me on
trust me this starts strange and just
keeps getting stranger
so what it says is that all your smart
devices emit positively charged
electromagnetic radiation your phone
your computer
that cell tower five miles from your
house it says that this radiation causes
symptoms like sickness
dizziness or and i quote hot head
syndrome
and that the solution is this product
right here
it does look a bit like a sticker but
there are some really strong reviews
here
my goodness i can feel the difference
already the aching in my hands is
permanently gone
now my phone never heats up anymore it's
permanently cold
and i quickly realized that these
radiation harmonizers
are a much bigger thing than just this
one website even amazon is full of them
sometimes costing extortionate amounts
of money
but again with very positive ratings so
i thought okay
something's going on here are there any
other products like this
i couldn't believe it there's the ener
band which apparently creates a
harmonizing field of negative charge to
neutralize the harmful positive charge
there's the stellar dome which you place
on the floor in a room and
has been tested 100 effective against 5g
there's anti-radiation bears plates that
rejuvenate your food
an ionic air cleaning wand and most
curious
is the geocleanse this seems like their
flagship product they can plug into the
mains and
apparently harmonize the entire
perimeter of your building neutralizing
over 30 forms of noxious radiation
and the reason this one is interesting
is that because it's an actual
electronic gadget
in theory we could take it apart and see
how it works
or prove it's a scam so i ordered it
in fact no i ordered pretty much every
single product on this entire website
and sure enough two weeks and 700
australian dollars later
harmony was restored my order arrived
and in it was a lifetime supply of
protection
enema bans stellar domes rejuvenation
plates harry potter weapons
stickers i meant radiation harmonizers
and a permanently energized koala
but i think what this company didn't
quite anticipate was their customers
having an actual electromagnetic field
meter
and check this out this is telling us
the amount of radio frequency radiation
in this room right now right now it's
basically nothing because it's not next
to any rf devices
but if i bring a phone in front of it it
does shoot up
and check this if i then send a text
message from that phone it goes haywire
now this might seem alarming and it
might make it look like the website was
telling the truth all along
except for the fact that almost all of
this radiation
is microwave radiation don't even think
about throwing that
which on the electromagnetic spectrum is
even less powerful
than the radiation of just visible light
so much
less powerful that actually the most
powerful microwaves
are only about 1 1500 of the power of
the least powerful visible light rays
but anyway let's uh apply this radiation
harmonizer
[Music]
did it just start beeping as i put it on
that's all good okay but what if we put
the enema band on
but maybe we need three of these
products let's put the stellar dome down
gotta get one of these rejuvenation
plates under there let's get the koala
in on the action
what do i do with the wand vada cadaver
and hey if you are enjoying this video
then a sub to the channel would be
magical but seriously i can't believe
this like who do they think we are
this is a stick of plastic it's got to
be one of the simplest
cheapest products ever to be
manufactured even wish.com would be
laughing about this oh
shut up and finally we've got the
geocleanse
now the website does specifically say
that it's been programmed to neutralize
noxious electromagnetic radiation but
tell me this
how do you program a bar of soap
well no to give it some credit it is a
bit harder than soap it's more like a
resin
but the point is this plug 10 amps 240
volts
it leads to nothing like i'm assuming if
we just peel the sticker off
[Music]
that's the other side of the plug you
know just to make absolute
sure hammer geocleans
[Music]
okay yep just a plug
[Music]
that'll do and
piece of plastic let me just reiterate i
spent 180
on that it was backed by hundreds of
positive reviews across many many
websites but all it is
is a block of plastic and maybe a fire
hazard
but it's only when i found the supposed
science behind all this that things
started to get
really concerning welcome to the gift
that keeps giving
their youtube channel do you remember
that product description that said it
had been tested for 100 effectiveness
against 5g
well this is how that test was conducted
they do one experiment without
geocleanse which basically consists of
someone
prodding various parts of this woman's
body and concluding that
yep her organs are not happy with 5g and
then doing the exact same thing again
with the geocans plugged in and just
concluding that oh
yeah she's fine now that's literally the
equivalent of
oh guys did you know that i've got an iq
of 690
look i'll prove it yep 690
it's not how you do a study but it gets
worse they then start waving this rod
around in front of her
they call it a bio tensor and they're
using the fact that it's moving in a
circle
instead of moving in straight lines to
show that her body's being affected
but i can literally see his hand
controlling it to do that
great experiment guys i'm pretty sure my
cat has that toy
he doesn't like it right now anyways
just to make absolutely sure that all of
this is bogus i decided to book myself
in for a consultation
so for the price of 50 they will search
up your home on google maps
and i guess based on what it looks like
advise you on your current
radiation situation so i created an
account and i set my location to north
sentinel island
which is arguably the most remote
location in the entire world
it's actually inhabited entirely by a
tribe called the sentinelese
who are possibly the only humans on this
planet to be completely without
technology
it's kind of crazy no phones no tvs no
internet they still hunt with bows and
arrows and
have nothing close to a wi-fi connection
so if there's ever going to be a
population that doesn't have to worry
about radiation
is this one anyways my consultation
boiled down to a series of emails
the guy started by saying he loved the
look of my island but couldn't find any
houses on it
no surprises there so i just sent him a
photo of a random tent i found on google
as my home
and then after a few more back and forth
like what part of the island i was from
i got my answers now what i was
expecting was for this guy to say
oh yeah you're surrounded by 5g waves
and that you should buy our products to
save you
wow and if you did say that then that
would pretty much prove that they were
making it up
because modern technology doesn't even
exist at that location
but the actual answer that i got was far
stranger
i think this person realized who i was
based on the email address i was talking
to him on
and then looked up photos of me and
based on those photos
came to the conclusion that my bio field
has a positive charge
and that because of this i have the
epstein-barr virus
or in other words herpes
can confirm not true but also enlighten
me
how does one measure the charge of a
person through a jpeg image of them
what are you like scanning the pixels of
my face with an electrometer
anyways all of this just leaves one
question these products are about as
useful as paperweights
to be honest that probably couldn't even
keep paper down they're extraordinarily
expensive
and they're backed by science that feels
less real than the entire harry potter
universe
why are people buying it and why are
people liking it
well turns out this started in the 1900s
with a guy called william wright
he decided that there was something
called orgone a massless substance that
was all around us in the air
the orgone was central to life and that
the lack of orgone
was what led us to problems this idea
stuck
and then as computers and phones started
ballooning tech became the enemy
and algon became the solution and
possibly the most pivotal and successful
product in this lane was a pendant
called
the q-link and i've got one right here
basically
this thing claimed to change your life
the box says it will give you more
vitality
greater focus improved performance
better stress response
this thing was praised by the times the
mail itv and of course it doesn't need
batteries because
well the copper induction coil means it
can be powered by the wearer
but jordan was funny they used to say
that the source of its power was a
circuit board that they'd had printed
onto earlier models
except this circuit didn't connect to
the coil or to a battery or
to itself it wasn't actually a circuit
at all which is why they then had to
change the design
and start including a little slip with
every q link they sent
which says no party involved with q-link
makes any claim that any of its products
are intended to prevent
cure mitigate treat or diagnose disease
you must not rely on any information
provided as an alternative to medical
advice
that's only like half of it but the
point is if you're already telling me
that i can't rely on the information
you're giving
then how on earth is this still allowed
to be on sale this is not a new branch
of science
it is literally taking existing science
and making it wrong
but this is where things get really
bizarre because it was at this point
that i realized that
the issue is bigger than stickers and
wands and pendants
if you start searching for general
orgone products you'll find pyramids
with over 2
000 five-star ratings on amazon orgone
generators which for some reason don't
require a power source
there's even a 5 000 5g fighter super
big legit apparently but just look at
the first seven supposed power
ingredients of it
polymer resin so plastic copper iron
steel
brass aluminium so basically what you're
saying is
i should just sit in my tool shed look
i'm not saying that as humans there
aren't things out there that we can't
see and experience there probably are
but what i am saying is that if i am
sick then sitting next to 5 000
metal poles or plugging a bar of soap
into the mains is not going to solve my
problems
but the reason that these products still
work against all odds is that
they convince people that there's a
problem they establish themselves as an
authority
and then they offer themselves as the
solution almost all of these product
descriptions start with something like
have you ever felt a headache or have
you ever felt you had tired eyes
to which of course people are going to
be like well yeah actually i have
they follow up by telling you that this
is not normal and that the problem is
either your phone or wi-fi or 5g
or some combination of them to establish
themselves as an authority
a company who knows better than you and
then they finish by saying
buy our stuff to fix that problem you
might have heard of the confirmation
bias
this idea that when we believe something
then we tend to focus on information
that confirms those beliefs so providing
that companies like this can make us
believe that their products will fix our
problems
then when we get these products we'll
convince ourselves that they do
like one of geocleanse's recommended
tests is to plug it in
and then put your hand against a fridge
they say you should feel like a calming
sensation
to be fat it does actually feel quite
nice but the point is it's got nothing
to do with geo cleanse
because they're priming people to be
ready for good things to happen when
they use their products
then when good things do happen to
customers then those customers attribute
those good things
to the products the only actual proof
that these things work
comes from customer feedback but that's
a self-reinforcing cycle
as more and more people leave positive
reviews for this stuff then it's even
more likely that the next customer is
then going to also believe they work
and then trick themselves into thinking
that they're seeing positive benefits
from them
these are nothing more than extremely
expensive placebos
and while there is a time and place for
placebo products creating the problem to
then sell a placebo
is borderline evil and i do not believe
that whoever made this
doesn't know what they're doing because
you can't manufacture something like
this you can't set up the factories and
create the molds and inject those molds
with plastic
and not realize what you're doing
disappointing
is it just me or is cleansed meant to
have an a in it
if you enjoyed this video then i've got
a really fun guide to crypto for people
who know nothing about crypto
and the smallest tech in the world up
here
thanks for watching my name is aaron
this is the boss
and i'll catch you next
hey my name is ben saul strim and i just
got a call from three six zero seven
eight seven nine one five five it's a
pre-recorded message that says that i
have a case against me with the IRS and
so i'm just going to call these guys
back here and let you see kind of what
the experience is like i do not believe
that it's legitimate and so far to this
point i don't want you to be scanned by
it it's early March of 2000 Revenue
Service this is officer on me flight how
can I help you hi officer I'm calling
this number back because I got a call
from it and just wanted to see what's
going on alright have you on the number
this number yes I received a phone call
on
can I ask ya like is there a problem or
what seems to be the problem then I
would just like to get and below the
information before going ahead and
providing any kind of information
because this lines often afforded by the
Julie members of the hotels and even the
IRS officers as well so I cannot go
ahead and provide any kind of wrong
information
sure sir before going ahead and
providing you any kind of information
can we just go ahead and let me out with
your post name and your last name
sure it's been so strim it's be en and
what will be laughing saul strim alright
alright and then what will be your data
put and your last voltages of your
social security number so that I can go
ahead and pull out your case file that's
information that I generally don't give
out over the phone without verifying
first who I'm talking to
how can I verify that you are with the
IRS written Ben first of all I would
just like to bear and let you know one
thing I'm not aware to prove you that
I'm calling you from IRS or I'm not
alright but if you want you can just go
ahead and
take a chance and you can disconnect the
skull and there will be a local sheriff
officer at Theodosius along with all the
legal paperwork's and he will show you
where the mistake has been done actually
there is a lawsuit file against you by
the Internal Revenue Service under tax
evasion and tax fraud all right Ben tax
evasion and tax fraud so do I need to
pay right do I need to pay you right now
to take care of it or how do I fix it
I never say that you have to pay me
right now to fix it up I only said if
you can get and help me out with your
date of birth and your last four digits
of your social security number just to
go ahead and pull out your case file and
your legal epidemic so I can read it out
for you but I'm I still haven't been
able to verify if you're from the IRS or
not so I can't
it would be unwise to for me to provide
you know I guess maybe an idea would be
do you have any native English speakers
there so someone who like was born in
America and raised in America that
speaks with an American accent this
point of time every officer busy because
there's thousands of case file which is
spending on us so we are working on it
and as I told you Ben I'm not a waiter
I'm not over here to prove you anything
all right but if you want you can just
go ahead and disconnect this for and I
was just going to issue your arrest
warrant all right over the next 45
minutes there will be a local sheriff
officer that will be an American officer
all right at your doorsteps along with
all the legal paperwork's and he will
show you where the mistake have done and
even prove you that I'm calling you from
IRS all right well here I told you will
he arrest me or what yes it will take
you into custody for the next 48 hours
and it will show you all the legal
paperwork's right and at that point of
time you have to fight the case against
IRS and if you win the case it's great
and if you lose the case IRS will sue
"you for $75,000 and each and everything"
under your neck that is your driving
license your
social security number along with all
the lands that you have in the your name
and your social security number receipt
by IRS human there will be an
imprisonment up to five years up to five
years will be non bailable oh man uh
okay well do you
is there another is there is there a
native english-speaking American there
right now as I told you I cannot
transfer this call to anyone I'm not a
 ice chips all right when they
better do you benefiting I'm not calling
you from IRS or if you think there is
any kind of doubt in you you can surely
go and disconnect the scope but be ready
for the consequences are you from where
were you born
I am an Asian Catholic I been in Asian I
am an Asian Catholic guy okay I walk for
IRS all right and I'm calling it from
the Investigation Department
okay what is your what is your first
middle and last name my first name is
wrong and what's your middle name
Nima and last name replay how do you
spell that
this w is an OSCE is in Edgewood HS and
Sam LS NEMA he is in Edward and why is
in Yankee okay is there a way that I can
see your profile with the IRS and like
verify on their website that you work
for them do you fine uh if I were
working with the I know you do listen
listen listen to me first
you know what what I'm gonna do now I'm
gonna go ahead and disconnect this call
and I'm just going ahead and issuing an
arrest warrant under your name all right
then just want you to know that it is uh
that you can go to do you yes or no
sounds good to you well know if you were
telling the truth but
I don't believe you but did you know
that it's illegal for you to tell me
that you can't okay there he goes
so that's the boat that's the Internal
Revenue Service that just called me and
I hope that I don't actually have any
legitimate problems but I'm 99.99% sure
that I that I don't so just watch out
for this and like I said this is a March
beginning of March 2016 and if you get
any phone calls from the IRS
specifically from that phone number that
again is three six zero seven eight
seven nine one five five it is most
likely a scam don't give them any money
don't give them any information working
with the IRS can actually be very
reasonable in the United States and you
should be able to talk to somebody who
is respects what you say and is willing
to go through the details with you about
whether or not it's a legitimate thing
thanks for watching I hope this keeps
some people safe and we'll talk to you
later

we're all tired of robo calls and scams
but we want to tell you about a new one
making the rounds that really looks
legitimate yeah the scammers are
spoofing the Social Security
Administration to try to get your
personal information no six investigates
karat Kenney joins us now with how you
can protect yourself some information a
lot of people want that's right mark and
Amanda what makes this scam so
believable is that the scammers are
spoofing the Social Security
Administration's 1-800 customer service
number so you get a phone call and your
caller ID will tell you Social Security
is calling you but chances are it's a
scam once the scammers get you on the
phone they act as federal agents and get
your personal information like your
social security number they might tell
you they want to increase your benefits
but it's just a scam the Federal Trade
Commission issued a warning today
reminding people the Social Security
Administration will never threaten you
they also won't promise to increase your
benefits in exchange for information if
they do it's a scam the best thing to do
is to not answer or hang up so if you
have any doubt hang up and call the
Social Security Administration directly
to ask if they have any outstanding
business with you
just remember to enter the number
yourself do not trust the number on your
caller ID Cara Kenny our TVs
I'm calling you from BT Broadband in regards to the Internet.
is it better now?
"Yeah, I can hear you better now."
Ok the reason is that we're doing 'some kind' of maintenance work
"so are you the user of the internet at the residence? 
- Yes I am!"
"Ok, normally when you go on the internet do you face any trouble with the broadband line,"
like the speed gets slow sometimes?
or the internet gets on and off?
"Sometimes but I regard it as normal I never complain about it...
-Sometimes..."
"Ok we have received a complain from the whole area Sir, because..."
the maintenance work is going and the reason is that...
because the reason is that the internet speed is getting decreased day by day
"so that's the reason we're calling you, we're working on the internet connection right?"
alright and you are from BT?
yes we're calling you from British telecom from the server...
Ok... right now can you please be in front of your system and switch it on?
why do I have to do that?
"so that you'll be able to check why the speed is getting slow, because"
when your internet apart from you there are more ten 10 people...
who is connected to your line... they're using your broadband...
So is for that reason we are calling you because we are not going to allow any people to get
"connected to your internet we need to
stop them people who are connected they"
"are not from your house or your
neighbors they are apart from the UK"
countries in different countries they're the hackers they are hacking down your
"information and we just need your
cooperation and your precious time we"
"don't need anything else to show you all
those are the people I fear to assess"
"and you can see how many of them are
connected and you can check the exact"
"date under timing when they have used
your internet"
okay and that's a tool that you guys in BT have? .... Yes!
alright!
"Ok just be on your home screen no need to be on an internet page, just your home/normal screen"
what is my home screen?
"that's your desktop..
Oh, desktop OK!"
"Ok, I'm on my desktop now..."
"Ok, have a look in your keyboard... you have a keyboard right?"
I do have a keyboard yes!
How do you know that?
"look on the extreme bottom left hand side corner, can you see there's a control key?"
Yes!
and next to that 'control' what key can you see?
Windows key!
Ok you need to press that windows key with 'one' finger...
"hold it down, and at the same time with another finger press 'R' ... 'R' for Romeo..."
"type 'CMD' ... C for Charly,  'M' for Mary and 'D' for David..."
CMD.... OK!
now OK!
I clicked on OK and there's a black box now...
Should I be afraid of that box?
"... no, you don't need to be afraid of that...."
"Look on the 3rd line next the 'user' there should be a cursor flashing, can you see that?"
I can see that...
type in there 'Netstat' (she spells afterwards)
"OK, I did it!"
now press 'Enter'...
I pressed 'Enter' ...
"now have you got any columns such as Active connections, Proto, local address, foreign address, state..."
Yes!
"these people are using your internet, these are the IP addresses from all those other people"
who are using your line.. right?
"So, is that what it means?"
"yes that's what was the thing I was trying to make you aware, because all these other people are not existing customers"
they're trying to use your internet illegally ...
"so we're not going to allow them to do it... we need to block these people from our end, ok?"
okay
I've just shown you to make you aware
okay so what can we do to resolve it?
"we're here to resolve it, we will fix it, we will block them, we will delete them from our end..."
so that in the near future it won't come back again...
you won't have any trouble because of them...
Ok
"OK, now you have to press that 4 flag windows logo key and letter 'R' from the keyboard once again"
like you have done it before
OK!
and try to type www. ....
WWW. ...
then A for Alpha... N for november.. (she spells the address as shown above)
...download...
"yes, download.."
OK
you will click on OK!
OK!
"OK look at the bottom of the screen, do you have anything comes up like 'anydesk.exe' ?"
yeah it seems is finished downloading
try to click on it then... all right I double clicked and I think is running
OK
let me ask you something ....
"Let me ask you something,,, you are from BT right?"
... yeah...
Why is it that this this is from a site called anydesk and doesn't say BT at all all right all
"Anydesk is the software, like is a security software.."
it has been provided by the telephone companies that BT is been given to use
alright...
alright!
"anyone can buy this, but as you are a costumer you don't have to pay for this"
but people who need to buy it from the outside for the business purpose...
"okay so this is free right this software
is free I'll have to pay for it so it's"
"yes, no you don't have to pay for it that's because you're a customer"
you pay for your broadband so you don't have to pay for it...
"so is a free service of BT then I won't have
to pay for this?"
Absolutely! No you don't have to
I mean how do these people connect to my computer? uh... because
"they're not connecting to your computer, like these people they're hacking down the IP address"
alright..
but is not only you the problem is going on with the whole area
because the hackers they're not coming  to your house or using your computer
"They're just hacking down your information, whether you connect with your mobile, your tablet, ipad,"
any device they can go through that...
not because of the computer only
"OK, could it be this because I've been
looking at websites with with attractive Ladies..."
... and that's what caused this?
sorry?
no it's just I'm wondering how these hackers found my IP address and maybe it's because I've been looking at
"websites with attractive attractive
ladies like with no clothes on"
maybe if you go to harmful websites they can go through that
"alright I should stop watching
attractive ladies on the internet right?"
"I'm asking for your advice because you
seem to know... your from BT so..."
(Background noise..)
I can't hear you...
I can't hear you as well...
you cannot hear me?
no...
we were talking about attractive ladies and..
as you is from BT I went to a website once and there was a lady wearing very little clothes ...
and I clicked on it..
that's your personal use... you can't ask me about this...
"alright, so I can carry on watching 'these' websites and..."
"and it's not going to bring hackers on
right?"
"yes.. yes, no..."
"alright, great!"
all right
we're back in your screen now
listen sorry to waste.... I just Google anydesk
and he says that is a scam and it's not BT could that be true?
distant tone... (she hung up)...
Ha-ha! ... oh boy!
is Bureau impersonation division thank
you all we are here today to alert the
public of an ongoing scam that's
happening out there in reference to
Social Security we want to make sure
that the public knows that people are
calling forcefully claiming that they're
from the Social Security office or from
other local state federal agencies and
the department has released a new public
video which you will see here shortly
and what we want to really tell people
is make them aware of this new Social
Security scam and what we want to tell
people is to make sure if they get a
phone call like this to please hang up
we've lost millions of dollars have been
stolen from have been scammed from the
public in reference to the scam in 2019
year-to-date we have had over 200
complaints and over two million dollars
stolen just in the Social Security scam
compared to last year in 2018 for the
whole year we only had three of them so
this is really important this really
does not affect you it affects all type
of New Yorkers all ages all races and
all genders I have fallen victim to
these type of complaints I'm gonna
introduce deputy inspector Jessica Cory
again and she's gonna be able to tell
you how these scams are happening
Jessica
Thank You chief good afternoon everybody
so with this scam what's happening is
you get a phone call and you'll you know
see Social Security Administration
you'll see NYPD you'll see FBI
something on your phone you'll get a
call and it could be a robo call where
it says you know please call back to
this number or it'll say press 2 and
you'll be connected or you'll get a live
call and what happens is you receive
this call and they tell you that your
social security number has been involved
in fraud or money laundering or drug
trafficking and they don't just ask you
for money right away what they do is
they tell you get a pen and get a pad
write this number down this is your case
number these are the numbers of all of
the accounts that have been opened in
your name they give you their
information what they also then possibly
transfer you to somebody else and that
person purports to be law enforcement
and they backup the entire story you've
been told they then tell you that you
secure your funds you have to do
something outside of the box which is to
go out and get prepaid gift cards off in
Google or Apple cards or Target cards or
go and put your money into a Bitcoin
account and basically you'll get your
money back eventually but you're going
to do this to safeguard your money and
they're basically terrifying people
people are terrified in this case and we
you know you think as they chief
mentioned this is not you here social
security you think senior scam this is
not a senior scam relatively few numbers
of seniors are scammed here it's mostly
younger people we had a taxi driver
leave a fare at LaGuardia and drive all
over the city going to purchase prepaid
gift cards we had a mother with two
small children and a an eight month old
baby
running around to Apple stores to buy
prepaid gift cards and what happens is
when when the scam is complete people
realize they've been scammed and then
they're embarrassed they're ashamed and
they don't tell people what happened so
we produced a video and we're going to
show that video to you we want to get
this message out
this is debuting today and we're gonna
play it now
like millions of dollars are lost every
year here's what you need to know can
you receive a phone call appearing to be
from the Social Security Administration
feed from a person or a robo call it's
very likely the businessman stampers use
technology called spoofing to manipulate
your caller ID so it displays the number
of the Social Security Administration
police or other other than agencies the
caller may say that your social security
number has been suspended due to
fraudulent activity or it's been
involved in a crime like drug
trafficking whether your bank account is
about to be seized or frozen the caller
may even say that there's a warrant for
your arrest often you will be
transferred to someone who is
impersonating an NYPD officer or another
fake law enforcement representative who
will back up the story they will scare
you into thinking the only way to
safeguard your money but to avoid arrest
is to purchase prepaid gift cards such
as Apple or Google Play the scammer may
request to send cash through FedEx a
Bitcoin ATM or to wire money to a new
protected bank account this is a scam do
not send payments under any
circumstances just hang up remember the
real Social Security Administration
police and other government agencies
will never contact you by phone and
demand payment or ask for your social
security number driver's license or bank
account information period if he was
money in one of these scams so as you
can see on the the card that we have up
here there are a lot of other scams
besides the Social Security scam this
one just has a fast growing scam and one
of the things that's so insidious about
it is that there's law enforcement or
potentially you know people are being
told the NYPD is involved and that we
really want to make sure that that
doesn't happen and people understand
that that's the scam but to talk about
some of the other scams that we have we
have Captain Michael Gandolfi who's from
our Intelligence Bureau and he's here
actually to speak about a personal story
that that happened with his family you
hello so my parents were the victims of
the scam one morning they received the
phone call and the scammer told them
that I was involved in a car accident
where I was texting and driving and I
injured a pregnant lady who lost her
child in the car accident and my mom
couldn't call me because my phone was
held as evidence so they used that and
then they fished my mother for
information they fish for my wife's name
they fished that for the fact that I had
daughter ultimately took taking over
"almost $30,000 from them one thing that"
I want to say is aside from telling your
family members and friends about these
scams it's important to remind them
because I have spoken to my parents
about scams before but some of these
scammers are just so good
that um it's it's worth repeating
you know for your loved ones and friends
yeah just hang up also
if anybody has any questions yes
okay I'm gonna give that to the
inspector that's a great question and
obviously that first and foremost in the
world of crime prevention and that's how
we prevent these things they use a
spoofing mechanism where essentially
you're going to see a number that
potentially could not only represent the
police or something to that effect or
become just unknown so with that
mechanism it's tough to backtrack if
that answers your question
it potentially can where you could even
spoof and once again for clarification a
particular precent or the like so the
vulnerability for that individual
obviously becomes enhanced than that
they do think it's the real police but
the real police are not questioning and
asking you to send money it just doesn't
happen
I mean it certainly wouldn't be an
essence of owing money or something to
that like yeah you know the police are
not going to ask you for money it's
simple as that so if that's the mask
that any mechanism or individual is
using its false period
yeah and once again just the message to
the Republic is every piece a potential
lead creates opportunity for the
investigation meaning if you send money
if you are a victim of this scam and you
ultimately send any amount of currency
those transactions those cards that are
sent normally when people use your card
they just toss it those are all pieces
of our puzzles you know so certainly
investigative Li that's what we look for
also the timeliness of the report we
have a small window of opportunity
usually 72 hours potentially to get that
money back a lot of people are
embarrassed and shamed if they're a
victim of this crime they have to come
forth
what we do have success stories we have
an arrest year-to-date
many of those investigations are still
active with sentencing pending so we
prefer and it just not to get into the
semantics of them
just that we saw the the huge increase
in these numbers and also the Federal
Trade Commission is seeing the same
thing nationwide I believe last month
"they reported that they had 76,000"
complaints regarding this particular
scam alone with 19 million dollars in
losses and that superseded the 2016 IRS
scam where they had 17 million dollars
in losses one thing I just want to
clarify with what the inspector said the
72 hour window is potentially for wire
fraud for money that was a sent via wire
as far as these gift cards usually
they're cashed in and almost immediately
and people cannot get their money back
well this scam went from last year being
three for this particular scam to this
year we have two hundred and thirty so
it's over a seven thousand percent
increase yeah I'm I mean while we think
there's one system where individuals
will actually have a really
multi-layered approach to this where
they'll basically go and do random
call-outs to individuals if somebody
shows a vulnerability you know for
example if I call and say hey your
grandsons in trouble and you say
something to the effect of which one
marker John I'm gonna play off that that
will then go to the next layer of
individuals that will try to circumvent
that and really work on that
vulnerability and work on that name and
and really create a bond if you will
between the two and making them more
vulnerable
so we look to get the information out to
you of course and try to see what we can
you know they change but it's always
really the same thing somebody's calling
you somebody's asking you for
information somebody's asking you for
money so it they really they change but
they're often really the same type of
scam and what we really want to get out
is don't give money to anyone who calls
you over the phone don't give
information to anyone who calls you over
the phone just hang up and that's really
the same for all of these scams no
matter what they are and also to talk to
a family member or a friend what I can
tell you with this scam when they have
you on the phone when they tell you
they'll build Google Places for you to
go to buy gift cards for instance when
you go to buy them you know we've done a
lot of work with the companies that sell
them and they try to stop the people
from buying them or the banks try to
tell people not to send the money but
the people don't believe them or they're
on the phone with the scammer the whole
time and that person is telling them
don't tell that person anything tell
them that you need these cards for a
wedding or you need these cards for
gifts for friends and things like that
so they stay on the phone there they're
very intimidating
so individually we've had losses we've
"had wire transfers of over $400,000 with"
"one person another person $49,000 wire"
transferred we have people going into
Apple stores and buying ten thousand
dollars worth of gift cards but what
they do is they tell them to go to
multiple stores so that they don't alert
so you know raise suspicions
so you basically purchase the gift card
and then you have to send them the
information off of the gift card and
sometimes they actually have you take
pictures of the gift card and send it so
this scam card that we have we have one
that's it says basically in
collaboration with this business and
we're working with all of the retailers
as we watch this scam and the other
scams and we look to see where are the
cards being purchased and we're working
with Apple and FedEx and Target and
Bitcoin vendor ATM vendors because you
know they're a lot of them are happening
there as well we're going to places
where they have Bitcoin ATMs and putting
up these messages at the locations

#NAME?
"If you're new here, welcome."
My name is Krazy Ken.
"And today, we're not taking our feet"
off the scam busting gas
because I've received tons of messages
about this very fishy advertising campaign
for the StarScope Monocular telescope.
"It seems a little too
good to be true, right?"
"And I will say right off the
bat, yeah, this is a scam."
"And today, we're gonna dive into why."
"So let's take a look at what
this telescope claims to be."
"The most common ad I saw for
the StarScope looks like this."
"A video which tells us the
backstory of the product."
They claim that it's only $69.
"In fact, it's actually cheaper than that."
"And it allows you to see
everything from miles away."
"And the creation of this
invention was made possible"
"after an intensive research
at Joe Hopkins University."
"Hang on, that can't be real, right?"
"I mean, I know of John Hopkins University."
Total B.S.
"And you know, my initial gut
reaction was that's Oxford."
"Just from the architecture,
that's what it looked like."
"So for grins and giggles, I
double checked and sure enough,"
that is actually the New College Building
at the University of Oxford.
And that particular stock footage clip
"is available on Pond5.com
from Brendan Riley."
They also claim the StarScope
allows you to see objects from miles away.
What they show in their video
"is an unrealistic outcome
from something like this."
"And we'll break down the
technical reasons why in a moment."
And they say it's like carrying
"a $4,000 DLSR in your pocket."
"Okay, first of all, no, it's not."
"And second, it's DSLR, not DLSR."
Don't know where they got that from.
"DSLR stands for digital
single-lens reflex."
That's what this type of camera is.
"So it seems like they're
making a lot of mistakes."
"And by the way, if you see
mistakes like that and you see"
"a lot of other grammatical
errors and mispronunciations,"
that's usually a red flag.
Maybe we'll call it a yellow flag.
Just be careful around that stuff.
"Also, I absolutely love how they say"
it sells from a modest price point
"and they show a shot of a
person shuffling $100 bills"
"like they just hired the
world's most expensive stripper."
Not a good image.
"And they claim the
possibilities are endless."
"Everything from birdwatching
to observing stars in the sky."
"And they proceed to
show an image of Saturn,"
which isn't a star.
"Now before we take a
look at more of the stuff"
"that these guys are
spewing toward consumers,"
let's break down the video ad.
"Next I want to address
the zoom test they show."
They claim that the StarScope is capable
of this extreme zooming functionality.
But what you're seeing is actually a video
from Platskoll on YouTube.
And the advertisers merely stole it.
"The footage you're seeing
is from a Nikon P900,"
"a camera with a lens that
has 83X optical zoom,"
"equivalent to a 2000
millimeter focal length,"
"which about eight times more
than the 10X magnification"
"in the first gen StarScope
and about five times more"
"than the 16X magnification
in the second gen."
"By the way, special thanks to Bajiru_cs"
for making this discovery.
Next point.
"Their ad shows different
products in different scenes."
"In the opening shot, you
see a monocular telescope"
with 16x52 magnification.
"But later, the product says 40x60."
And the design looks different.
"Then in the ending title
graphic, it says 10x50."
"More inconsistencies
equals more red flags."
"And by the way, those
numbers mean two things."
"The 10X, for example,
is the magnification."
"And then the second number
is the diameter of the lens."
Next point.
"The screen simulations
are presented poorly."
"In this shot, the user's hand is shaking,"
but the image on the screen doesn't shake.
"If this were a real
demonstration of the product,"
"the bird would be shifting
and shaking in the frame"
while the user's hand moved.
"And there's no disclaimer that
this is a screen simulation."
"They also try to show
this quick zooming motion"
onto the bird subject.
"But when you observe the
video frame by frame,"
"you'll notice a cut
before the bird shows up."
It's merely two videos spliced together.
"And if I had to guess,
none of these videos"
"I don't know, overall,
maybe StarScope is using"
some magical technology unknown to man
and it's actually a very capable device.
I guess we'll see once we test it out.
But my B.S. detector is still going off.
But it doesn't stop there.
Now let's take a look at their website.
"Their website claims StarScope
has zooming capabilities,"
not just a single fixed magnification.
But the problem with that is
"you never see a zooming
mechanism on the StarScope."
"What I mean by that is,"
take a look at a traditional camera lens.
"When you zoom, you may see
something like this happen."
"The higher the focal length,
the more zoomed in you are."
And it's usually done by twisting a ring.
"But on the StarScope,"
"we don't see any of those types
of mechanisms taking place."
Where are they?
"No idea, but you see plenty of footage"
of people zooming in on a subject.
It's probably a bunch of B.S.
My theory is they're just using
camera lenses on real cameras
"and they're passing off that
footage as StarScope footage."
"Also, I've discovered articles,"
"which in this case are
just ads in disguise,"
that show more comparisons
"between the StarScope and a $5,000 DSLR."
"Oddly enough, the article is inconsistent"
"with the product name,"
sometimes calling it Cosmic Scope.
"Here's another comparison they show,"
which makes absolutely no sense.
"For starters, the photos aren't even taken"
"in the same location or
at the same time of day."
"But let's make pretend
that they were taken"
"at the same location and
at the same time of day."
"What are they trying to
prove with this comparison?"
"That the StarScope can
produce better dynamic range"
"and you can see details in
the sky better than the DSLR?"
"Wrong, lenses have little to
no effect on dynamic range."
"Dynamic range is affected
by the camera sensor,"
not the optics.
"And since the StarScope
isn't actually a camera"
"and it doesn't have a camera sensor,"
"why are they even bothering
with this comparison?"
"Makes no sense, they're
just trying to fool you."
"Their site is also riddled
with fake scarcity discounts,"
which never actually expire.
"And there's reviews too,
which are likely fake"
because the website tries to format them
"into a live looking
Facebook style interface,"
"but none of the like or reply
buttons actually do anything."
And the dates never change.
"But oddly enough, the
profile pictures change."
"And the new people look nothing
like the previous people,"
yet their names stay the same.
Why even do that?
I have no fricking idea.
They just made it 10 times more obvious
that this stuff is fake.
"Now before we continue, I do want to say"
I am making hypotheses here.
When I'm critiquing the hardware features
"and all the optical
functionality of this product,"
it's all hypotheses
"because I haven't tested
the physical product yet."
"But I still think I can make
some educated guesses here."
"So with all of this
evidence, it's pretty clear"
"that this stuff is
shady and scammy, right?"
"But now I need to put my
hypotheses to the test"
and actually try the product.
"So, I went ahead and bought one."
At least I thought I did.
"The purchase process was riddled
with fake countdown timers"
and annoying post-transaction upsells.
"But that crap aside, I was
actually able to use Apple Pay"
and complete my purchase.
And I was given a confirmation number.
"But the weird thing is, I never
received an email receipt."
"So I waited for a day, and nothing."
Still nothing.
"Now, I'll be honest."
I kind of got distracted
because I was working on other episodes
"and I kind of forgot to
check for confirmation."
"But then I remembered
like maybe, I don't know,"
"two weeks later or so, and still nothing."
So I gave them a call.
"To their credit, the customer
support was super friendly."
"But what I found out was
the transaction was aborted."
- [Man On Phone] (murmuring) shows that
"the transaction for the order
and also for the payment"
has been aborted and canceled.
#NAME?
"So at this point, I'm super confused"
"because the website said
the order was received"
and I even got a confirmation number.
"But sure enough, I checked my bank"
and no transaction took place.
"But the company still had
my phone, email, and name."
So some information went through.
"So to make up the time,"
I decided to buy the product elsewhere.
"But sadly, loyal viewers,
I regret to inform you"
"that this product is
not available on Amazon."
(melancholy music)
"Oh, wait, here it is."
"Well, let's go ahead and order it"
"with Amazon's new portal shipping,"
and it should be here soon.
(smashing)
"Wow, that's convenient."
"Full disclosure, guys."
"I accidentally bought the
first-generation StarScope,"
"not the G2, which I guess
apparently is the one"
"that's on the website when you
actually go to purchase it."
"But there's three different
models in the video,"
so it's really confusing.
"Either way, the design looks the same."
"The only difference I
could find is that the G2"
has 16X magnification and this has 10.
"So, sorry, slight difference,"
"but I think given the circumstances,"
we can ignore that little variable.
"Okay, now let's go ahead
and test this bad boy out."
(duck quacking)
"Okay, so my tests are
done and I value your time"
"so I'm not gonna show you
every single thing that I did."
"But in short, all of my
predictions were correct."
The first gen StarScope does in fact
have 10X magnification.
So that feature is properly advertised
"in certain parts of
their marketing material."
"But remember, this is
not a full frame lens."
You will constantly experience
this iris effect in all of your photos.
"But to be fair, they
demonstrate that in their ads."
So at least they're being honest here.
"But regardless, you
won't be able to achieve"
the same optical quality
"that a true photography
lens can reproduce."
"You also can't magically
stabilize your footage,"
and there's no variable zoom capabilities.
Another inconsistency I noticed
is my particular StarScope says 40x60.
The StarScope website says 10x50.
And the Amazon listing also says 10x50.
"So I'm not sure why these
numbers don't line up."
"But from the measurements I looked at,"
this is definitely not 40X magnification.
It only looks like 10.
And the diameter of the objective lens
is not 60 millimeters.
"So if you want to get one, go for it."
"Just make sure your
expectations are in sync."
"Because the big problem
with this whole thing"
"is not the product itself,
it's the false advertising."
StarScope oversells this thing.
They make false promises.
They push false advertising.
They post fake reviews.
"And they value this thing
at a ridiculous $80."
"But on the bright side, thanks to this,"
"I can now see bull (beeping)
from three miles away."
"As always, feel free to subscribe"
to the Computer Clan YouTube channel here
"so you can catch more of our
tech episodes in the future."
We got some cool stuff planned.
And if you want to help fund
"the future of the Computer Clan,"
"and help me buy more knockoff
crappy products to look into,"
feel free to pledge to my Patreon.
"And in exchange, you will

when you do so.
Thanks in advance for your support.
"And hey, if you liked this

scammers are now blaming strangers for
hitting their cars in the hopes they'll
pay up as Denver 7 Shawn toll reports
the kind is sometimes convincing but
always threatening scam phone calls are
nothing new all the sort of scam calls
that people get social security or
either turning your power off it's
usually an operator but the call that
Dru Ferran got Sunday afternoon took
some additional effort this was a live
call from a local Denver area code
number and the guy knew my name on my
phone my and the color of my car so you
know clearly they're doing their
research now get his information in
order so that was that was a little
alarming and that person on the other
end was very aggressive wanted my
insurance information wanted he kept
saying he wanted money and he kept
saying things like you sound like you
have a lot of money Farren tried to ask
questions of the caller knowing he
didn't hit him but the only answer he
got he just kept saying I want money I
want your insurance info wouldn't answer
any of my questions because he didn't
budge the caller eventually hung up
Farren wants others to know this game is
out there and no one should fall for it
I'm sure one out of a thousand and one
out of a hundred people are gonna say
hey I'll do it everyone else any my
social security number my credit card
just leave me alone kind of thing which
is why phone scams still happen Farren
alerted police and added the number to
the Do Not Call list that sounds like
these scam calls are kind of progressing
and getting maybe a little bit more
sophisticated so it's maybe getting
harder and harder to tell what is
legitimate and what's not so if you're
unsure just hang up
Shawn toll Denver 7
it's about six o'clock the drive's been
running all night we don't we can't use
it in fully auto at the moment because
of the
way the boiler's set up running off the
hot water so just come checking it
anyway i'm gonna discharge in a bit just
gonna put on a cooling timer this you
know you can see but look at the
moisture that we've driven out of this
today
that was put on last night and then this
floor
hasn't been turned on yet because we
wanted maximum drying on one of them so
that we could then just change it quick
and get another batch in so i'm just
going to saw the dryer now and then
hopefully we'll get some more corn
coating a bit
look at all them that seem to have took
root in the yard because there's some
spill grain everywhere let me
any shooting
big drain wash through there hit it with
a combine yesterday and then
richard didn't see it and fell down it
with the fast track thought he was going
to roll it because the whole wheel
literally fitted in it
it's just after nine o'clock this is the
earliest we've ever got caught in but
it's really damp but it was really damp
yesterday got rained off last night
man there's a chance of a shower coming
over about sort of 10 o'clock
we might try and see if we can get this
field finished
probably got about 15 16 acres left in
it
and then it could be wet again all
weekend as well i know we've got
tomorrow's supposed to be on a bad day
but the idea was just try and get this
finished strong and spring valley finish
to the side of the railway and then the
combine is finished up here we can take
it back through the garden this is the
first time we've ever come up here and
cut everything while we've been here
because
normally the oil seed drapes not ready
before well we know we have winter
barley it's ready then we come back very
early right then we'll come back for the
wheat maybe the bees this year we've
been able to bring the combine up here
cut oil seed break the same day we've
been cutting wheat and then cut the
spring bar the same day a quick week so
the whole thing's already at one go
which is unusual but it's good for
logistics
just going really steady though because
like i say it's uh it's saying it's 29 i
don't think it's that wet but
it ain't it ain't very dry
i forgot to say the chopper off so i've
ended up chopping a little bit anyway
i've put the straw down now
i'm just gonna empty before we get to
them power lines because they're quite
low and obviously
quite high
and the windows really need cleaning
[Music]
getting close to the wires now
gonna fold down
and then
go underneath
so now the orb is safely
stowed away at the back folded in the
mirror
under we go it's not too bad because
it's not massively hot today but on a
hot day you don't have to droop because
the copper expands and gets longer and
droops closer to the floor
just had a random phone call off google
which annoyed me because apparently they
run up wendy in the office a few weeks
ago and said
they were updating the details and
checking the addresses writing the phone
number for the company name and whatever
and then they were like you want a free
google app page for the for a month and
for a trial
she's like well i'm not paying anything
it's free whatever so they did us this
free page unknown to me
um they made up all the stuff on it
there's nothing to do with me so they
put a lot of generic pictures on of like
rubbish tractors
and like a tiny little doits and stuff
like that
then they put a load of waffle out we
grow grass fed beef livestock and we
harvest our produce to minimize the
damage and all this stuff it's like
absolute waffle that's nothing to do
with my business
and then now they want me to pay to keep
it there or edit it and i'm like you've
just misrepresented my business for a
month
and you want me to pay you i said you
need to put it right for a month and
then i'll think about it well the guy
didn't seem to get it but it's just i
don't think it's on that the google that
big that they can then put
this online presence that's that's fake
for a month and with no room you know
like nothing no come back it's really
wow
the rain's come the fields started to go
grey spring bar the other side of the
railway is now getting wet and i'm
waiting for a trailer because
andrew was off disking this morning and
we didn't think we were going to get
anything cut and we decided we had to go
quick so we've got this little bit left
to do so the trailer won't be too long
and i could just get the last bit done
then we might have to come back for that
spring barley
i went to check the bar the other side
of the railway it's currently really wet
anyway james got back with the trailer
empty the tank and set up again so
didn't it see now i'm getting wet in the
rain
can't really see the rain but it is
drizzling
on my shoulders can you yep just
the deer as well i missed the deer so
the deer came out with this field went
through that gap and then into the trees
over there so i didn't get it on video
though because i was on the phone
just follow the order out now
basically i think it's about 10 meters
the order because it goes 12 meters from
the machine but from this angle you can
really see how big it is
it's not forget to see it from behind
i'm feeling unloaded now
it's it's coming out quite slowly
because it's so
is another block that damp finished
there you go you can see the rain now
when it's damp it runs on the bottom of
that flap when it's dry it runs on the
top and we don't need the bottom of the
flap it's weird really that's why i'm a
bit like that whether to cut it off or
not because
likes today we want that extra bit to
flick it into the trailers but when it's
barreling out dry it's hitting the top
of the spout and that's what started
coming over the other side of the
trailers
[Music]
that's the wheat finish cutting now at
rainel just a little bit ago it's
currently raining
i feel like a broken record because
basically this last few weeks all we've
been doing is combining the rain which
is not normal whatsoever
so that's a wrap on this now we can't go
over to the barley because obviously
it's raining but maybe later on today we
might get some more of them who knows
instead of going straight across there
we're gonna go around the diversion so
i'll time-lapse it
[Music]
there we go we're back down on the road
that was the diver if it takes about
four or five minutes
we don't know whether we can fit the
combine down that narrow road because
you noticed there was bollards and like
crash barriers on the side
looking good
do you never reverse the fan
take it off
if you press the reverse fan it'll blow
off that now
this is past blown out some jet washing
we have this stapler for stapling stuff
like when we're doing the maze and i
didn't realize it's got automatic mode
so if you flick that that way
look at that
[Applause]
that's the fly out of it
well dangerous
it's called that
open field wagon just got royalty
breakfast another wagon coming to
royalty from brookfield
at the garden center looking for some
hedging for the back of the yard where
we put that fence and some trees for
either side of the gate of the new
farmhouse to make it the step look a
little bit more inviting
sam's hearing the pickup so he doesn't
damage them we don't
they won't fit in the car
way back from the garden center we've
just had a shower anyway it's rained at
one end of the yard not at the other end
of the yard that's how localized it is
so if you go around that corner there
the rope the concrete's dry
that dry here it's not rained
round about updates four o'clock
everyone's gonna own
next door doing a bit of plowing the
soil destruction
just at the aptly named rain hill
because it seems always rain
sam's got a road train on the go
because we're going to go across the
railway so we just like to show them
that it's not just them that can tow
lots of um carriages
so hopefully we've got 40 acres other
side of the level crossing
we don't really like going in that field
unless we're going to finish it but
we're getting frustrated we've got loads
to do we want to get that barley off get
the combine back get back into wheat so
we're just going to go and try and cut
it now
got our new level crossing now nice
rubbery can't slip over on this
big black cloud behind us belt of rain
coming in there you can feel it on the
wind
hopefully we can get it done though but
we'll see
blue skies on the way
we literally
got across the level crossing which
takes a bit of
messing and now
we've got
rain
what a joke he's literally following the
railway let me see the cloud there
i thought it was a couple later on i'll
just sit and wait and see what happens
sam's just spotted that blue sky over
there but unfortunately we haven't got
any fields over that way
right we waited five minutes it stopped
raining it's obviously raining over
there at the top of the hill where we
cut wheat the other day so that's the
straw wet again
but there's this belt here and i have a
feeling it's not raining that side of
the field i'm going to put the header on
try and get around the headland and see
and if it's not raining that side of the
field i'll start over there and then
work back
if it's rained all over and we can't cut
them we'll have to give up but we're
going to try
how to tell it's wet combining without
telling when it's wet combining when the
trailers are tipped up at the edge of
the field
draining the water out of them
so where have you come from uh southwark
suffolk where that trailer's made
all the way
sorry it's just on the phone wife's
telling him off because he stood next to
a combine and they're on the way to the
lakes they've been in some flowermate
and they've been around liverpool as
well so give everyone a wave
there you go you're being tonight
we took the header off we decided to
give up
it it's that wet and it's making a bit
of a mess of the field
so we're going to leave it till tomorrow
because what i'd maul cutting in a
couple of hours tonight
i could do in the morning and maybe two
it's a bit of a
got a bit of weed in it as well this
field was destined for support but like
i say um last minute it was changed to
spring barley because we let down by
some well not really let down they just
decided they wanted another field
instead it was easy to dig the spuds off
so
it never had a lot of potential because
it's quite a wet field and we all have
said all that bad weather as well this
year and the dry weather and everything
so we've not spent a lot on this crop
it's just kind of it was more of a cover
crop to but anyway we'll come back to it
tomorrow and see if we can
get it finished
now forgot to tell you so that that
thing this morning with google yeah
google is out it wasn't
well this company kind of rung up and
like made out that they were ringing on
behalf of google but really they were
putting you on google themselves and
getting your code off google to sort of
represent your business's google
presence
which is free
and then they put it on wrong and then
they were also then trying to correct it
but then go oh we're doing this for you
and you can pay us 250 pound a year or
150 pound a year for us to manage it for
you when it's free to do so i know
they've been told where to go so um
just be wary of anyone if you've got a
company said that someone doesn't ring
up and pretend to be google it's a bit
like when people ring up go ringing
about your mobile phone but they're not
ringing by from where your mobile phones
come from they're just they just know
your contracts up so they're trying to
get you to to move over to them anyway
they run wendy and she didn't really
understand what was going on and um yeah
they were trying to sort scammers a bit
really
look at the size of that spider
look at this thing this massive it's got
disabled access it's like it's like a
flight of stairs they're not steps them
there we go
let's see on the air hold on
look how straight then rosa with the gps
we're in the massey slum in
it on the fast track quick quiz question
what's that for that button
if you think you know leave a comment
below
just come for a quick look at the oil
seed raid and it looks absolutely
fantastic
it's now been in the ground uh i don't
know two or three weeks maybe it's
basically stitched across the rows which
is good because it'll keep the pigeons
out
a little bit
a little bit behind just here but i
think it's just because the stubble's a
bit higher and it's harder to see
yeah it's just not quite
quite meeting across the rows here
but i'm well pleased with that a little
bit of grass weeds in it but we'll knock
them out but
yeah that's pretty good to be fair
we want cabbages by christmas and then
the pigeons can't land in the canopy
then
it is good this fast track having the
sat nav screen there but the only thing
is is it really makes it blind looking
to your right hand side you kind of like
gotta
pee it forward when you come to a road
and you're like
like to see what's going on
anyway that's probably about all for
today on the wet annoying day if you
want to watch all the videos over there
if you'll subscribe it's over there
thanks everyone's watching and there's a
guest outro and i'll see you tomorrow
hi I'm David Coleman here with CBC
marketplace thanks very much for joining
us on Facebook and on YouTube we're here
to talk to you about the CRA tax scam
it's a scam a lot of you know about
because how many people aren't getting
those phone calls these days in Canada
for those joining us from the United
States you will know it is the IRS scam
basically comes out of the same place
I'd like to bring in Mark Simpson who is
a former fraud chief with the Canadian
police force now teaches at Niagara
College towards a st. Catharines area in
Ontario a mark when you hear about this
CRA scam what what are some of the
things that immediately strike you how
big and complex it is David the state
said abroad and biggest question I have
and I've had the calls like everybody
else why are we doing anything about it
in terms of law enforcement there's been
a little bit here and there as much as
we can it's tough yeah and as you know
mark in the course of our own
investigation at marketplace we went to
India we were able to find at least two
locations where these scam centres were
operating we're targeting people in
North America where you on is has a
question on Facebook the big question is
why is asking on Twitter why is the RCMP
not taking action and mark we know
through the course of our investigation
that we went and met with the Indian
police and the Indian police said they
are willing to take action but they need
to hear from the RCMP and according to
the Indian police anyway they say they
haven't heard from the RCMP do you have
a sense on on why that might be because
the RCMP in fact did not respond
directly to that question with us well
and as we discussed in the show I think
a lot of services are looking this this
is a fraud in reality it's an extortion
so it moves active a lot higher up on
the list of priorities and things to do
notwithstanding that thousands or
hundreds of thousands of victims
losing their life savings in a lot of
cases there is something that can be
done and I don't know I don't understand
why it's not being we have the resources
and the RCMP has the Canadian anti-fraud
centre at its fingertips they've run it
they're partially responsible for
managing it we can certainly supply
intelligence to the Indian police and if
there's a lack of communication I think
that needs to be fixed it's certainly
that's one thing that people are asking
about today Basma is on twitter saying
that we know that vulnerable people are
being targeted we know it's often the
elderly we know it's often new Canadians
immigrants who are coming and and Bosma
is asking how they know personally so
much about those they're calling and I
that's my I know just from our own
investigation at CBC Marketplace that
sometimes it's just a cold call but when
they think they've got you hooked they
have a team of people who actually look
up information about you online you know
your address is often publicly available
or other things on LinkedIn or social
media to try to build a case that they
know you and therefore they are more
legitimate mark you probably have some
things to add to that as well about how
it is they know about this there's that
absolutely David on top of that for the
more sophisticated crime rings that are
operating out of India don't forget
about the dark web - there are millions
of people globally that have had their
identification or identities compromised
and that information is out there for
the taking
and that's that's a total other offshoot
of this issue whether or not they have
the info or not yeah you're right
they're gonna get it they they sweet
talk to call the callers into providing
exactly what they need and they just get
more and more as Bosma you were also
asking about the guy who leaked this
information and certainly in our own
investigation we had people helping us
who were on the inside people who had
recently been on the inside we've taken
our usual but very specific precautions
to ensure
that they are safe and there are people
who have essentially confronted guys we
had one guy who went inside a hidden
camera he was wearing in India got
discovered they ripped his shirt off
smashed the camera
certainly a scary moment but he is safe
now he was not hurt he was able to get
away and we have confirmed that he is
safe to this day and that certainly is
something that concerns us
Adam B was asking on YouTube what number
did they tell us to call you know these
robo calls come in and and mark we see
they we see the call display but one
thing that we've learned through this is
that they change the numbers like every
12 hours
they often buy VoIP voice over Internet
Protocol numbers and they change them
constantly but also they have call
spoofing which allows them to make it
look like they're calling from another
number even though they are maybe even
from a legitimate dra Canada Revenue
Agency number mark you might have
something to add on that absolutely and
that is a huge part of the scam any of
us in Canada here there's Steve a call
from the six one three area code and the
caller Ids themselves as a canon Revenue
Agency operator or investigator the
first thing you're going to think of we
all know Ottawa six one three absolutely
mark sim Cheston is joining us from
niagara college
he's a former fraud chief with a major
Canadian police force helping us
understand that CRA scam thanks for
joining us on Twitter on Facebook and
YouTube on Facebook G dist react or DES
true Zak excuse me are asking why these
guys aren't being prosecuted mark
they're they're in India and so
cross-jurisdictional always makes it
more difficult but we also heard and
we've been talking about this that the
it doesn't seem like at least when you
listen to the Indian police that the
RCMP maybe aren't reaching out to them
and saying look a lot of Canadians are
being affected by even being victimized
by this is it just not a priority if
that's the case for the RCMP
it may not be I can't speak for the RCMP
but because this offense are these
offenses have elevated themselves to the
point that they're now clearly clearly
called extortion people being threatened
people being followed it's it's doable
now and as we discuss on the show it's
difficult yeah but there's a couple of
ways to go about it one try and catch
the back end here there's always going
to be runners and affiliates here
working for the primary group in India
but secondary to that we can be a
supplier of intelligence right across
Canada some services in Ontario for
instance where I am they've done a heck
of a good job following things up and
getting some of the runners but it's
tough and international investigations
I've done a whole bunch of them they're
tough but the provision of intelligence
to an international agency is easy yeah
and that's that's picking up a phone and
making a call and making a request yeah
and we have black we have RCMP lasers
all over the world and including India
that can help middle that conversation
with the Indian authorities so there's
lots of things that can be done my
emphasis would be doing a group think a
group project of sorts not necessarily
pinpointing the bad guys here because
they're over there for the most part but
working on the Intel side and then
providing it after the fact I've got a
bunch of questions here coming in from
Rob from Darren from Petra and another
one from Adam D on YouTube so I'll get
right to them Rob on Facebook Rob
Mitchell's asking if this is there
anything that can be done to get the
money back what do you think mark is is
it gone Oh fortunately it's done I got
it that is a reality we face you know
one of the things that they're asking
people to do now is put money into
Bitcoin machines into Bitcoin ATMs those
are untraceable
it's it's over Darren is asking do they
use other platforms such as mobile tax
now that's not something we saw but mark
you've got experience in this field as a
police officer what do you think in the
beginning now we've elevated to new
levels so technology is getting better
and better in Texas Petra is asking on
Facebook why don't they just run ads in
Petra I assume you mean by this the
federal government that's er a Canada
Revenue Agency why don't they just run
ads on TV and radio in multiple
languages outlining that the CRA just
doesn't phone like this and then make a
toll-free call of a number just to call
and report these kind of things make it
visible so Petra a lot to unpack there
first of all there is a place to report
it it's called the camp Canadian
anti-fraud agency a Canadian anti-fraud
centre and and they actually do take
reports of it but you know to your point
about awareness certainly if you go to
the CRA website it tells you the
conditions under which they would call
you and that they would never threaten
arrest or anything like that
but there is this question around should
there be a greater public awareness push
from the federal government mark your
brief thoughts on that briefly yes and
you know what we're getting to that time
of the year again where people are gonna
start prepping for tax season and the
calls are gonna start coming back fast
and furious they haven't ever stopped
Adam D on YouTube is asking about the
phone carriers those who provide the
phone numbers to these scammers why not
just crack down on them Adam is asking
well that perhaps you're probably going
to have to go back to the Indian side of
the house and ask the Indian authorities
I'm sure they try I know they've made
some major arrests as are outlined on
the program but you guys have seen it
firsthand you've seen exactly what they
saw you know admittedly they have their
hands full
and it's a toughy but that
number issue is not this country's yeah
and it is challenging because they do
change their actual phone number
repeatedly like it can be as often as
every 12 hours or sometimes even more
often than that but one of the things
that we noticed is some of the phone
numbers they use these VoIP these
internet phone numbers are actually from
Canadian providers now not necessarily
the big guys but smaller operations and
these are being bought in bulk it's
unclear to us exactly how you could
crack down on that we just actually
don't know Daniel Joseph though is
asking on Facebook can we build roads in
Bell for each scam call we I'm gonna
know mark now mark has been talking in a
couple of his responses about the show
so mark and I met each other as we were
putting together a program for CBC
marketplace in Canada you'll watch that
tonight Friday night at 8 o'clock and
every time zone 8:30 in Newfoundland and
the that show basically takes us to
India because we have so many times
heard from people who get these scam
phone calls we've heard people who take
on the scammers and maybe yell back at
them or ploy them along for a while we
wanted to see who they were and so we
were able to over the course of several
weeks track down who they were Kareem is
commenting on YouTube and saying they
also started sending CRA spoof emails
regarding tax refunds that almost look
legitimate and wondering if I've heard
of those I have not mark what about you
no I've not come across yet and one
thing that we noticed with a lot of
scams it might be this one it might be
you know there you've won a lottery you
want an inheritance that there's often
the oh well you've won you've got it we
can give you a lot
money but you gotta send us a little bit
of money hundred bucks a thousand bucks
first just to take care of
administrative fee mark when you hear
that as as a former fraud chief with the
police what goes through your mind when
you hear about someone being offered
something but you got to pay a bit first
well it's too good to be true that was
normally fraud for decades not just
years decades
I think that's fallen by the wayside
there's not too many people fall for
that anymore however occasionally props
up there was one recently at rid of it
you know I can't much time with major
fraud and doing these projects I can't
emphasize enough then and now again too
good to be true it ain't and just be
careful out there
nobody's nobody's going to ask you to
cash a big check or send a big amount of
money along they just keep a little bit
of it for yourself because they can't
little circumstances are just ludicrous
however some people again the elderly
new people to the country some of them
don't understand our laws maybe this
okay Ivy Allen and Audrey we're getting
your comments through on Facebook we'll
try to rip through them here Ivy is
asking is there something we can do as
individuals to get the government to
make public announcements to push it a
bit you know Ivy more than sixty
thousand people have complained about
being targeted and it's information that
the federal government has at their
hands so I know it's not like the feds
don't know this is a problem it's not
like the feds don't know that people are
actually getting scammed so it is a bit
of a question about what more we could
do as citizens to get those in power to
actually recognize it Merck what would
you say try and talk to your member of
parliament
letter email whatever tape through the
Canadian anti-fraud centre ask them we
need to report your crime because you're
going to be a victim that lots of people
are are you doing anything about this is
this information being routed anywhere
there's it's hard to go after your local
Police Service because their hands are
tied as I said and you will say on the
program the Canadian anti-fraud centre
takes there keeps the stats for the
entire country it's at their fingertips
bottom line is we can stop all of this
and all of these people's questions are
absolutely legitimate but send our
information over there to the Indians
who desperately want it and they'll act
on it because they've acted on the us of
information you know mark here's an
interesting question from Alan Brian and
flows right out of what you're talking
about now Alan's saying I've called the
police and was told not to bother
phoning as they've already received too
many calls doesn't I don't have that
detail in here but that that essentially
there's no point in calling to report it
because there's too many people like you
know to collect yeah Audrey Carey is
asking on Facebook are these guys also
calling about computer problems because
I've got those kind of calls as well and
Audrey I'll just briefly answer your
question to say yeah there's a Google
scam out there there's a microscope
Microsoft scam they claim tech support
it's not exactly the same call centers
but often they are call centers in India
so why in India because India actually
has a massive call center industry you
know if we call the bank and you'd call
the toll-free number pretty good chance
your calls actually being connected to
India those are safe and secure call
centers the Pearl
is out of a business that employs
millions of people that there are some
bad actors who are leaving we know how
to set up a call center and are doing
really bad things soif e is asking on
Twitter another question are there tech
solutions like there is in terms of spam
filters for emails are there tech
solutions that either the government or
telecom companies are working on Merck
you ever heard of anything on the
Canadian end can't comment on the Indian
end that they would have it's
complicated
there's technology for anything and
everything out there but it all depends
on the resources including financial
resources that you have available to you
I'm David common with CBC marketplace a
consumer affairs program that's been
looking at the CRA tax scam one many
people will be familiar with they call
you up they say oh you didn't pay enough
tax or you made a mistake and you're
gonna get arrested and we're sending the
police to you right now you're gonna go
to jail unless you pay money right now
we've been looking at that in part
because we went to India we identified
where some of these calls are coming
from done a program on that but happy to
take your question on that scam or scams
like it Mark Sanchez 'some is with us is
a former fraud chief now teaching at
Niagara College in Ontario and Sundance
Kid is asking on Twitter mark our
politicians doing enough to pressure
foreign governments to fight these
crimes and that mark is you know because
we've talked about it it's an
interesting question because when we
were in India we asked the Indian police
why they haven't gone after these places
targeting Canadians and the Indian
police said to us well we need to hear
from the RCMP where a complaints based
system and until we hear from the
Mounties that they have complaints we
can't do anything and they claim that we
they haven't heard from the Mounties
when we asked the RCMP they didn't
directly answer that question or that
assertion so mark you know when you hear
the Indian police saying that is it a
cop out on their part or are they
legitimately saying they need help the
Indians
legitimately
and what we're doing here or what we're
not doing again I can't speak for what
the Mounties position on this is there's
a lot of things going on in the world
and is this their priority I don't know
but if you add up the numbers and if you
add up the number of victims out there
and add some really really simple
straightforward investigative solutions
to them and accomplishing the
information in the paper media campaigns
it's it's not rocket science
there is something that we've done and I
think Canadians are fed up with things
not being good is number of people
commenting on the social media feeds
that are connected to this right now
and we thank you for your comments and
questions let there be no doubt about
that people are saying that they are
getting calls from outside of India
they've gotten calls from numbers in
from every state in the US now I will
point out Pamela Keefe you're you're
making this point just because it says
the number is from a certain state does
not mean that's where they're calling
from what we know about the Indian
operation is that they can make it look
like they're calling from anywhere they
can make it look like they're calling
basically from your next-door neighbor
but they aren't there half a world away
mark any comments on that no Tina is
asking on Facebook it's a good question
how do the scammers get the phone
numbers particularly if they're looking
at elderly people where those numbers
come from this identity massive breaches
of security at institutions financial
institutions anything we see them in the
media once in awhile where such a
central company has been breached the
the Canadian credit bureaus get involved
they have to iron out all of that mess
because a lot of personal information
was okay and then again as imaginary you
know a number of people are also asking
about whether these calls are
originating from China one thing that we
know from this particular scam the CRA
scam is that there there was a time and
there's very few that are now doing it
but that they would ask that you make
your payment using iTunes cards or gift
cards and scratch off the number and
give it to them a lot of people at that
point would hang up and say this is a
scam but those who didn't you know what
was happening was those numbers were
being routed through China was taking a
cut some you know shady business person
was taking a cut in China the rest of
the money was going to India where the
scam was actually running from we have
never heard of this particular scam
operating from anywhere other than India
but that's not to say it doesn't mark
these really could operate anywhere
absolutely crime groups and that's
exactly what they are is to set up this
tentacle network of there's all over the
world so it's truly global makes it more
difficult for police to investigate
that's one thing Rob Mitchell is asking
on Facebook are they doing these scams
in other countries and Rob just to pull
out of the conversation we were having
about where they were coming from who
are they targeting yes we know that
they're targeting Canada but some of the
same call centers are simultaneously
calling Canadians Americans British and
Irish people and in fact they use the
time zones to their advantage calling
European countries earlier in their day
and then North American countries like
Canada in the u.s. at a later point they
sort of stagger where it's happening
heather Bell has an interesting thing
that she's asking on Facebook she says
after I speak to a real CRA person I
often get one of the scam calls within a
very short time Heather's asking is
there a leak at the CRA
you think no no I'm just a coincidence I
friend of mine same thing exactly the
same they in fact she could have been
the one that hosted that it came in
within a day of her having to
legitimately call the CRA and she went
she my friend went through an absolute
grilling process interviewing the CRA
employee to make sure that they were
legitimate so the tables were turned
there for a little bit but no no leaks
from them
Kevin Bob Lawson is commenting that he
loves getting these calls because he
plays along with them as long as he can
Kevin you know that's an interesting
lots of people do that lots of people
have told us today that they do that and
Mark I'm curious to get your thoughts
because what I've been saying to people
and I hope that I've been right is go
ahead do it and my logic behind that
mark is that they're these are small
teams and if you're consuming their time
it just means they're not scamming a
vulnerable person out of their money if
you have the time and you're so inclined
and you want to do it go for it but mark
would you say something differently time
I play with them I try to get some
decent intelligence if I can I know any
fraud Center so I'll give them my name
and information any day but yeah you're
absolutely right
have fun with it brag to your friends
that you had fun with it any attack came
along for a half an hour so and get
exactly what you said but at the end of
the day it's it's unfortunately mark
Simpson who's joining us from Niagara
College in Ontario Canada has asked to
go at this point just because he's got
some other things going on but we're
still happy to keep taking your
questions all I'll look after them mark
thanks so much for joining us really
appreciate it thank you for having us
though as we let mark go there and it'll
take a little while for his video to
disappear on you I'm just gonna add
answer
a couple of things done' polgár is um is
asking on facebook she says i've had
calls from nigeria market you you should
feel free to hang up I should just say
you know don't feel you gotta sit there
you and your team there can hang out
perfect
Donna polgár is asking on Facebook I've
had calls with Nigeria and why aren't
you talking about that as well that's a
really good question Donna we have never
heard of this particular scam emanating
from Nigeria we've heard of other scams
coming from Nigeria and we at CBC
marketplace were really focused just on
this one scam the CRA scam because it's
one of the largest cyber schemes ever in
Canadian history so it really was our
focus this time that's that's why we're
not talking about other scam and there
are many other scams that are out there
certainly Victoria Joss is asking it on
Facebook is it possible for phone
companies to stop this Victoria that's
not something that we specifically
looked at but Mark was asked a similar
question a bit earlier Marcus in Chesson
he was just with us a short time ago a
former fraud cop and his response was
just that it it's very difficult for
these phone companies to necessarily
know what what's going on but it's not
necessarily impossible because huge
numbers of phone numbers are actually
being cycled used by these bad guys
basically and they change the phone
number at least every 12 hours so is
there a way perhaps to identify bulk
buyers of phone numbers like why does
anybody need 75 phone numbers a week
that might be a way to trigger it but
one thing we've learned about these
scammers is they stay one step ahead
when they were becoming very obvious
having giant operations in India they
went to much smaller ones like a dozen
callers and they'd move every month or
two
Erin Rachel is also asking can they
still get your info if you don't call
them back and Erin that's a that's a
really good question
the answer generally is no I mean that
the key information they want is money
they want to know how to get your money
and they're gonna look for a way to get
your money in an untraceable format so
oh you know just having your bank
account numbers for instance that's not
good enough they're not gonna be able to
access your money just by doing that so
generally speaking they if you don't
call them back you should be fine all
right if you get that robo call at home
it's a it's a scam if it's obvious like
it's a robot you know this is Canada
Revenue Agency forget it it's not real
hang-up is not gonna be a problem
Byron Armstrong's asking on Twitter why
doesn't the RCMP or FBI simply make it
impossible for them to make up calls why
raid buildings use technology simply tie
up their phone lines you know Byron
that's a good question obviously I'm a
journalist and not in law enforcement I
know no tech wizard it's hard enough for
me just to bring this video up here
today so why don't they it may be a
question of priorities that there's more
public attention on things like murders
and so they put their their resources
everybody's resources are limited in to
that kind of a thing or if it's fraud
they're looking at big fraud you know
million dollars and up or it may be it
may be something else it may be that
there isn't technology or that the
scammers are outsmarting the technology
that's out there clays smart asking on
Facebook where do you think the database
of numbers are coming from the proposed
victims numbers clay that that is a
question we've tried to answer so it's a
there's a couple of possibilities one is
there's no logic at all it's a robo
dialer and it just goes sequentially and
there's no connection to any reality at
all another one is that it's an
electronic phonebook that makes a little
less sense because frankly we're on cell
phones that aren't in phone books a lot
of the time so then the next question is
there's a really good chance it's coming
off the dark web it's stolen phone lists
from wherever you name it and they are
just entering those numbers building an
algorithm to strip it out of some
database sticking it into their robot
away they go Curtis gray is asking on
Facebook what happens if you call them
back okay first of all don't call them
back but if you do they are going to say
you know what's your name and then
they're immediately gonna tell you well
you made a mistake on your taxes you owe
money and you owe money now they'll say
an amount they won't say it right away
but they will get to that point and they
then they will offer you help after
threatening you they will offer you help
and say we can do something but it's got
to be right now you can't hang up the
phone you got to deal with this right
now they're gonna look for a way to get
money and then the way they get money
varies increasingly now it's it's
getting people to go to a Bitcoin ATM so
Bitcoin a cryptocurrency which is
effectively untraceable and that's why
these scammers really like it because
you put your money in this this
automated teller machine that is
untraceable not even a bank can go and
say where did the money go
Jordan is asking on YouTube is the
government of canada doing anything to
take this seriously
are they capable of making a deal with
foreign governments to end this global
criminal ring so you know I don't know
what the RCMP you're doing behind closed
doors I'm a journalist not a police
officer and and and the RCMP obviously
don't want me knowing what's happening
with the insides of their investigations
but I can tell you about our
communication with them and here's how
it went down
a couple of years ago in India the IRS
the real IRS the real tax authorities in
the US we're getting a lot of complaints
from people who were getting calls like
this so they called up the Indian police
and said guys he had to do something an
Indian police did the Indian police did
a massive raid hundreds of arrests and
so when we were in India we went to the
police there and said if you did that
for the Americans and Canada's having
the same problem why not why not do
something for the Canadians and the
Indian police said to us we need to hear
from the RCMP we need to hear about
complaints and at least according to the
Indian police they have never received a
call from the RCMP so we called the RCMP
they wouldn't talk to us on camera they
simply said to us that the best way to
prevent these types of crimes is through
public awareness they did not respond to
the assertion from the Indian police
that they've never made a contact now if
that's true and if the Indian police
really do need a contact
well no not nothing is happening I hope
that essentially it addresses your
question are they capable of making a
deal with foreign governments to end
this or at least address it I don't know
if they can end it can you limit it can
you prosecute it
the Americans have found a way to do
that and it resulted in a lot of arrests
so that's essentially a lot of what
we've been getting up to over the last
little while thanks so much to everybody
who is tuned in for this Facebook live
it's also appearing on some Twitter
streams and also a YouTube live stream
really appreciate all the questions
we've had if you want to see more about
this it's always more info CBC news dot

explanation up there about our
investigation in India trying to find
these guys these scammers behind this

how not to get scams if you'd like to
see the documentary we did it's airing

spirit to agree with you beautiful now
wait a minute how would you feel if
somebody threatened your children would
you not know that I told you I thought
y'all free mason free Irish the devil
nothing can it happen to my children
that I give you my word

somebody threatened to hurt your
children would you not be defensive and
protect them
do you defensive and protect them right
now
no I'm saying can you blame a mother for
protecting her children would you not do
the same for yours
I don't blame your just your children
and every one of your children who want
the best for your children but sometimes
you cause problem on your church
suppose tomorrow is cops in your five
desert and why would scope
they wouldn't hear you like how I just
wish you and tomorrow yours you will up

think about that but I don't know what
would you do what would I do I know it's
nothing to you I don't have to think
what would I do
okay well that's the same way I feel
okay well you're going to see a zombie
tomorrow but you're enough to end up the
key you want to see because you probably
encountered an ecology I was interested
in how to punch
Tony record ended you are you disrespect
I don't like to be disrespected by just
one that's not disrespectful that's
being precautious and I would think that
if somebody was asking you for money and
telling you you had won something like
that you would be smart enough to do
anything okay be honest with a stupid
person if someone punches you listen who
who is stupid enough send someone your
money to never apply for anywhere
winnings I just I feel okay important
I'm playing a prank I called and said
you have one hey congratulation father
and who's the stupid one who you should
bring who is the one who is arguing the
people that send your money are the ones
that are stupid right you should you
have to blame they never applied for any
women okay I understand that but why
would you get angry at somebody who's
smart enough to figure it out
ma'am I know you're joking from the
vision and you think I'm stupid but you
just [ __ ] off [ __ ] up my day and right
now I'm not in a great mood
why don't you mean joking from the
beginning what do you mean yeah I know
you are kicking it for a joke I'm smart
enough to know that you don't send money
to win money so that's what I'm talking
about so why would you get angry know
what y'all are doing is wrong go I mean
on your money honestly yes listen you
can kind
we'll have tensions I don't have
conscience
I'm not some off you worship the devil I
don't know where your conscience would
come in decided no unversity devil who
wouldn't have a brush with the devil
there's a lot of people nowadays that
worship the devil
lots of crazies out there and really
believe that I worship the devil
well I mean that's what you've told me
so I don't know if you were not I hope
not for your children's interest in here
oh well I'm glad to hear that I'm glad
to hear that
what personal chat I'm pretty low for
two minutes uh-huh
you're here yeah uh-huh oh you wanna you
want to really know why I do it
you really would know like yes it would
make me feel a little bit better because
you've been pretty hateful to me am I
was just plain I was just being what
you're gonna do well that's not nice I
mean there's somebody who has children
that's just not nice I earn money
honestly we're not rich I'm smart enough
to catch on to stuff but I don't
understand what somebody has to be so
hateful because I never was that way to
you it's what you told me you tell me um
you tell me something because I told you
I was recording a call which honestly I
feel like you got offended just because
you were mad that I was smart enough to
catch on no no you tell me I don't
really remember what you told I didn't I
never threatened you on the most of you
as I was working from the at your on so
you I I don't remember exactly what you
said that I was offended by one well I
apologize for that but I don't believe
us that anything nearly as offensive as
you did about certain and me and my
children
yeah listen I mean ooh we are and I you
don't think I would do something like
that I have like it reason why I said
that I was a seeing what we gonna do
eating I don't hear if you want to
record it is your yeah I don't hear I
don't care i do this prairies and i have
my reasons my reason first I don't know
you I have my reasons why I try to I
don't despair if I have conscious some
of you must be what if someone should
shut it down or someone in my family out
idea well I just think that you need to
put yourself in other people's shoes
because when you say such hateful things
it really is awful it's just really
awful but what just to threaten such
horrible things that you've done is just
really awful everybody has problems
everybody has problems and I mean I'm
sorry okay I'm very sorry to trap me
that was because that was just mad I
can't do one [ __ ] and I delivered that
ledger state so I just really want to
hear what everything well I've been
threatened by many people and I will say
from what you said it was just very
hateful ma'am listen if you get to know
me you'll you surprised that I say such
King I just hope that you know you will
rethink ever saying something like that
to people because anybody you're talking
to on the other end of the line they
have since I haven't saved it like lying
or even like the reason why I cry 'no i
have sharp temper I don't like people to
respect me well I don't really respect
people well if you get me out that's all
okay well you know you have to earn
respect you know you have to earn it if
you treat others I but you'll be treated
nicely but when somebody will select
somebody's trying to take advantage of
you you get defensive and you know
everybody struggles in life but we need
to try to do what's right I mean that's
part of being a Christian and she's
trying to do the right thing and but you
know that olive arm you cannot just go
or not even a password understanding
that I understand that trust me but you
know it I understand that it's hard and
everybody has to support their family
but you know you're taking from others
just honestly you know and I know that
people when you're dumb enough to fall
for it sometimes you're think of what
serves you right I agree with that to a
certain point so what are some of these
person def get ripped off they don't
deserve it now I'm saying that sometimes
when people are just so dumb to send you
money
I agree sometimes you think well you
know what you were done the mess offend
it so it kind of makes you feel a little
bit better about it but you know Aries
just because somebody's false or
everybody's just hoping to get rich
everybody wants the same thing
why but we don't need to do it by taking
advantage of others we need to do it the
right way and follow the Bible M what
I'm saying I didn't say I don't follow
the Bible but sometime you have to do um
that stuff you are tough to understand
you don't understand the weary from what
we do for living you don't understand
what we go through I don't know what
you've got what's going on in your life
you're right you could be going for some
awful things a lot of people are but we
need to help each other instead of
trying to take advantage and honestly
believe now listen to me I honestly
believe in karma and if you do people
wrong I think that it not only comes
back on you but your children so just
try to do better and if you have a
problem with your temper just get a
little bit of help and I'm all getting
from myself but I don't like people
disrespect me I don't blend just
disrespect people like you okay well now
when you called me and you try to take
me for it oh and want me to send you
money I feel like that's disrespecting
me so we both were disrespected Oh
I'm sorry to disrespect you but you can
do what you wanna do I don't like people
tell no what if you you because better
if you do not tell me even if you were
recorded in this and give it to the FBI
would all telling me that would won't be
any problem you're telling me and I
don't care that's why I know he's even a
third card and I don't care I don't care
if you give that but they can do me
anything it's not freemason or anything
what I'm not stupid enough look I'm just
trying to help you I want you to just
think before you call people because you
know people work hard for their money
and everybody wants to be rich and they
are sending you money in hopes that
maybe you're telling the truth and
there's a lot of people that fall for it
I'm sure but it's just not doing it the
right way yeah well you think I'm even
if I listen to what
so you think finish up your melee enough
people doing this ship
oh I understand there are lots of people
doing it but that doesn't make it right
that doesn't make it right there's lots
of people killing people that doesn't
make it right and you know what's right
deep down in your heart and you need to
try to do what's right well you know I'm
just telling you you will feel better
inside if you would just try to do
what's right and it's hard being a
Christian in today's world and it's hard
to go but if you treat others they want
the other that you would have them do
onto you and you will feel better inside
because there's lots of people that are
just plain hateful but I don't feel like
you are I feel like you just needed a
little bit of God what I did call you
and tell you need up to hundred dollars
and carve an identity for three weeks
will you send me the money but I'm not I
have five children myself I'm not in
completion distend money I don't try to
watch you I understand
I think lately I understand that you
know you have to earn money the way you
do I understand that everybody needs to
earn money in today's world it's hard to
earn money but you just you know it's
like you're taken from others it's just
not right it's just not right I mean
there's got to be a better way I have
five children and I have not had any
college education but I will get out and
I will clean streets and mow grass to
get money before I would take from
somebody else I understand every ten
years fee I just want you to think about
it because I know when you don't if you
were to see me face to face and be
talking to me I don't think you would
ever be a tight force you were on the
phone but it's you know it's a real
person on the other line and they have
feelings
especially and your children and your
family and everybody is family everybody
we are all just trying to make it in the
world and be Christians and hoping to
get to heaven there's no reason to do
others this way oh I'm being honest
today I'm gonna think about it I cannot
just be I'm losing you
I'm trying I appreciate it I appreciate
it and just pray about it you'll feel
better you you'll know what's right
inside it's instinct you'll know it I
think boys for me to say all this can be
nice to you after you threatened to be
in my children because you know if you
want to make somebody mad you certain
them children and that's why you did it
you wanted to get under my skin but you
know that it's not right it's wrong so
just think about it before you do that
to somebody else because you could
really scare somebody and you know
there's people that can't sleep at night
for fear of just living in today's world
it's so awful we don't need to do that
to each other I know I have to go right
now I have to go horsey shopping or like
it okay well you just pray about it okay
oh okay all right thank you yeah what

hey everybody Chazz Marlar from pair of
dice paradise and just a couple days ago
there I was sitting at my computer
editing some video when the phone rang
and imagine my surprise that on the
other end of the line was Publishers
Clearing House telling me that I had won
1.8 million dollars not only surprising
because I've never entered their
sweepstakes but because Publishers
Clearing House does not actually call
its winners nope
calls from Publishers Clearing House is
a well-documented scam fortunately just
happen to have my video camera sitting
on the table next to me that day so I
decided to play a little game now
technically it's not a board game but it
is one of my favorites to play so I
thought I would share it with you in the
form of this public service announcement
enjoy yeah those the ones with the doors
with the balloon no no no I haven't
[Applause]
liked well not today
but maybe like what date range no no no
I'm actually not able to get home I'm
stationed on an oil rig so I'm out off
the Washington State Coast so not not at
my place of residence right now my this
stint is six or seven months depending
on you know depending on how much crude
we get
it really really depends you know if we
get a really good vein we could be out
of here in five months but if it's it's
just a trickle the foreman says that
we're looking at closer to eight no
she's not home very often she works the
little dinghy that helps guide the ships
in from from the bay out to the oil rig
so she's she's out nearly you know 14 16
hour days sometimes depending you know
again how many boats are coming into the
rig and how much how many barrels we got
offload each day so so she's kind of
hard to get ahold of is is is it in her
name where is it in my name okay if my
wife's not home could there be someone
else there that would be able to claim
it for me hmm how about because we moved
across the country for the drilling job
so we don't want to have any close
relatives nearby how about a really
close friend covering Greece here can
you hear can you just I got a pen can
you tell me your number
name in Washington okay oh it's like
like yeah like the state where in the
oil I'm glad you told me because that
doesn't match the number in my caller ID
at all so that that's good yeah hang on
hey Tony for I need the forum and to
give me a new allen wrench set because
we've got the Johnson writes all Johnson
rod is all screwed up over here yeah I
need the big the big allen wrench set
and some paper towels because we got
exactly the big big roll of paper towels
to go with the big allen wrenches cuz
everything on this oil rig is huge
um can you tell me what's the statute of
limitations on how long
[Music]
because everything on this oil rig is
huge okay thank you yeah get those to be
at Sue's I'm off the phone I'll pick
them up from you

cement as this oil rig
[Music]
you
It's time for Nergasm
"Hey, what's up guys, Jerry here, a.k.a. Barnacules."
And today I was woken up this morning
from a dead sleep by one of those Microsoft scammers.
"You know, the guys that call your phone and say:"
"Oh my god, we found a virus on your computer and we wanna help you get the virus off your computer."
Blah-de-blah-de-blah.
"Well anyways, he asked me if I was sitting in front of a computer"
"and I said ""You know what - I just woke up, so why don't you give me"
"an hour and call me back?"""
I spent that hour setting up a little virtual machine
that he could do anything he wanted to
"and decided to shoot this whole video for you guys,"
so I hope you guys enjoy this completely unprompted and unplanned
Indian Microsoft tech support call.
Enjoy!
Jerry:  Hello?
"Scammer:  Oh yeah, Mr. Jerry?"
Jerry:  Yes!
Scammer:  Sir this is Charlie Williams the computer guy. Remember I give you a call before?
Jerry:  yes I do
"Scammer:  ok, and at that time you were busy so you told me to give you a call back half an hour."
"Jerry: Yes and now I'm sitting in front of a
computer - could you just give me a moment please?"
Nope.
"Jerry: Oh, ok. *Scammer spells out msconfig*"
Jerry:  it says system configuration
"Scammer: Correct.
Now if you're going to check at the"
"top there will be uh several tabs like uh
general, service, boot"
"you need to give a click on
service."
Jerry: On services? Ok I see it.
"Scammer:  now just below the services
at the left hand side"
"do you see there are certain services, at the middle column"
"there will be manufacturer and below some that say Microsoft Corporation, ok?"
Jerry:  Yes I see this.
"Scammer:  Now at the right hand side column you can
check the status - some say running"
some say stopped.
"Jerry: UHHHHHHHHH? Ok wait, what do I got to click on?"
"Scammer: You don't need you to click anywhere, you just need to, I want you to just scroll down the window"
"top to bottom and check how many
Microsoft services are being stopped."
"Jerry: ok let me see here the ones that say
Microsoft Corporation?"
Scammer: yes the ones that say Microsoft Corporation that means that one of your
"services are given by either
Microsoft Corporation"
Jerry: ok I see them | Scammer: now you can see more than 10 to 15 services or more than that
"services status say stopped, correct?"
"Jerry: yes I see a lot of them | Scammer: right now the
reason we called the past few days"
whenever you're browsing the different things in websites there are few
"infections you are getting into your
computer automatically"
"Jerry: uh oh | Scammer: now because of there is a latent
infection which is corrupting the"
near almost every Windows computer with the named as Code Red (scary).
"which is basically act to get a file
with this computer to your browser like"
"Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Internet Explorer"
whenever you're browsing it. Now once that file is going to get into your
"system that is going to similarly
corrupting the other files at the"
"software which is stopping all the
background services came from the"
Microsoft Corporation
"which may harm your operating system. Now because
of this software infection recently"
you know Mark Zuckerberg he's the co-founder of Facebook. His account also got
"hacked, if you you know hear the news. Like his Twitter account -"
"his second account, also, you know, got hacked"
"now because of this issue, you know we take initiative"
"so we are making a regular service called to the
registered user"
so we can let them know about this issue. The new computer problem is
because of infection
"there are a few Microsoft services and
applications that are not receiving the"
regular updates from the main servers - that is the only reason all those in those
"services and applications that being
stopped in your computer"
"Jerry: Ok, what do I have to do? | Scammer:  ...don't worry about it that's the only reason we made a call with you"
"so we can help you to diagnose the
problem and help you resolve it"
"you do one thing for support close that
window, close that msconfig box"
Jerry:  ok. | Scammer:  now you need to press that Windows key and the letter R one again as you did before
"Jerry:  ok. | Scammer:  yeah, is the box is empty? | Jerry: It is now."
Scammer: okay you need to type there W W W dot | Jerry: OK.

Scammer: P as in Peter (x2)
"Scammer: O as in Oscar, R as in Robot, T as in Texas | Jerry: OK."
"Scammer: put a dot, M as in Micheal, E as in Edward"

"Jerry:  It's asking me how I want to open the
file with Microsoft Edge - oh with Edge?"
"ok its opening. | Scammer:  It's asking you how you would open the file? | Jerry:  Yeah, but it just said"
"Microsoft Edge; I clicked on and it
opened up"
ok it looks like I am on a website called Rescue?
"Scammer: Yes yes, do you see the support connection enter your 6 digit code?  | Jerry: I do"
Scammer:  Ok let me give you the six digit code you need to put inside the box
"where it asks you - give me a minute let me
generate a code for you"
now the code you need to put inside the box
"that is 1-2-1 | Jerry: 1-2-1 | Scammer: 7-5-3 | Jerry: 7-5-3 | Scammer: Now just below, do you see the start download?"
"Jerry: I do | Scammer: Give a click on that | Jerry: Okay it

Ok it said uhh... (background noise) Ok a little thing popped up said technician would like to perform one
or more actions on your computer do I just push OK?
"Scammer: Yes, press OK button. You might gonna get a few more 'OK' options"
every time you see any option come up on your screen asking you for ok continue

"Jerry: Ok, now it just shows the TEQFLY support application | Scammer: Correct"
"can you see any option ok there just let me

*crickets*
Scammer: Now it seems like your computer is working very very slow | Jerry: It is.
Scammer: Now you can see your computer
successfully connected with our help desk and just minimizing all the screens
Jerry:  Ok yeah let me know what you're doing because I'm I'm not used to doing this stuff
"Scammer: Ok, no problem - I'm just here to"
"bust apart, show you the issues"
which is everything computer we can you check
why your computer is not receiving the regular updates from the server
"and we're going to check the network
file of the computer, and after that"
"we're going to let you know what other
problems and what we have to do"
to fix the problem
Jerry: okay thank you. | Scammer: Now is this the only one computer which you have or do you have another computer
"Jerry: I have like two or three computers
because I have like a laptop and then I"
have my to desktop computers
"Scammer: Ok and all these computers, you are the only user who uses it or anybody else use the computer?"
Jerry:  I'm the only one that uses one of the desktops and laptops but one of
the other computers get used by my kid.
"Scammer: Ok, now first of all I have checked already. There are a few softwares that are being stopped."
"Now let me show you just because of some
of your Microsoft services are not"
receiving the regular updates.
"they're getting stopped. What kind of
problem your facing with the computer and"
"the reason why your computer is running
slow"
Jerry: Ok | Scammer: How old this computer is? | Jerry: This computer is probably about two years old. | Scammer: Two years old
so its not that old. | Jerry: no | Scammer: so here you can see this is event viewer
now event viewer is a window where we can go ahead
check what applications are running on your computer and what are the status
regarding to the old internal services and the applications for the computer | Jerry: OK.
Scammer: so if you need to check the administrative events here
"I want you to check there is a list of errors and warnings | Jerry (sarcastically:) Oh wow, there's a lot of them."
"yeah if you can check at the top the
number of events that your number is 516"
"now if you check the date and time of some of these, very recently like 7/2/2016 - it's today."
"Now let me tell you on the phone, if you're taking all these errors and warnings"
these are the viruses
"let me telling you - basically whenever
any of your Microsoft softwares and the"
"services may not make you receive
the regular updates properly"
"they stopped working on computer at that
half your computer is keep trying to"
"update that service you know in a
regular basis but they do take the"
multiple attempts but at somehow because of your computer not receiving updates
"the files enables you updates
properly and at that half your computer"
"is going to create a certain error and warning 
messages as it is right now"
"creating at the physical field you know, uh, in here the total number"
"more than 516 errors and warnings
till now already generated | Jerry: Oh..."
"Scammer: the only things getting so much of you know
except made from hard disk"
"this is a one of the big reasons why your computer is running slow,"
"because, as the day passes,"
"the number is going to keep multiple but
you know right now the field number is"
"500 but within a few days the number may be thousand, then two, then four (thousand) | Jerry: Oh wow."
Scammer: the errors on the computer
"they're going to keep multiple
themselves they get thrown off the"
computer for it | Jerry: how can we fix this?
"Scammer: well, uh, in regard to this, we can clear all these"
"there is no big deal with that but you
know, we need to clear that right now"
you once again going to create errors and warnings. So basically we want your
"personal information that the problem you're not
gonna face you can be sure there for"
"that we need also started with the
application to repeat the problem date"
"from the main server automatically in a
regular basis if all the application for"
the services given by the Microsoft Corporation are going to be read properly
your computer is never going to face that problem again.
now let me just go ahead and check for the protection and anti-virus or protection you are using
"oh yes way out because i also don't need
any of the perfection on your date"
"upbeat though you know what is the
windows defender it"
Jerry: I've seen Windows Defender pop up before but I don't know what it is
ok let me give you free knowledge
Here on the google search and we'll type
Windows Defender
"check this length that wikipedia here
and thank you . uh complete definition"
"about the windows defender but I want
you to read out to life with based"
"windows defender at the top of the
product that the dance to detect and"
"remove Melvin (dammit Melvin) it both for really about
the bx virus program in fact that you"
(audio is sped up)
In that case
you will have to get a Windows defender which is bascially your anti-virus program
"which is not only going to protect your computer from the viruses, but the spyware too."
have defender protection the computer that is going to give you the complete
protection for the computer  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
"Jerry: OK. | Scammer: once you're going to repeat, once you're going to use the Windows Defender,"
"you need to get a certain benefit, if you are using for example"
"using a norton or mcafee or just with me
with a computer that is just that virus"
program
it is only going to secure your computer from the viruses but if you're
"using the windows defender that has been
provided you know protection not only"
"from the viruses but for the spywares too, and the second thing"
"this is a microsoft confident a windows
part of those"
"it's completely compatible with the
computer Windows Defender application"
"not gonna station much space of the
computer so that it's not going to slow"
"down the computer and was a very
important part"
"you don't need to upgrade renew or give
up that any money for the windows"
"defender but this is a microsoft product
which is same as a computer"
"it's just that once you use the windows
defender that is for as long as you have"
the computer
"after that you don't need to buy purchase
are you know I use any other protection"
with a computer
"let me check the status of the
windows defender in your computer"
Shortly there will be a Windows Defender you can have
"let me check that was here it a try see
it and I get to stay in business"
"PC status protected, real protection is on"
"virus replication is that that means the
windows defender perfection which are"
"having in this computer that is working
properly in this computer"
"now you can ask the question if the
windows defender protection is running well on your computer"
"why your computer may be a problem like
that the only reason that windows"
"defender is showing you that indicated
is protected but as the windows defender"
"also microsoft partner like your
computer not receiving any regular updates"
"from the Microsoft server that for the
reason that all your windows defender"
"also able to pick up here and a hundred
question that only means that you're"
facing this kind of issue
now let me just check that natural part with
them here
"now whatever we all the computers that
you're having a few rather that all the"
computers that are connected to the same network like the wifi
"now you're going to see I open up black
window now i'm going to type here and"
N. E. T. S. T. A. T. that's for the net state like the int your network status now if we can
"track the status here you can see below
that the connections there is"
"three layer local address, foreign address, and
the status"
"check with the local assets there
will be a particular one IP address"
192.168.245.247
"ok this is the local IP address of the
network which your using to get connected"
the computer to the different websites
"like okay okay but if you can check more
thing"
"the foreign addresses there is a
no such IP addresses that is similar to the local addresses"
They're just a random names and numbers
but the letters ending with HTTPS
usually we see the HTTPS stands for the internet
"now here if you can check the status, the first one says established"
"that one two three four five state
TIME_WAIT"
the last two say ESTABLISHED
now the number of foreign IP Addresses
the status saying they're established
"They're already having access to your network.
now the number one thing TIME_WAIT"
somehow enables you to have no connectivity to your network
but the three foreign IP Addresses
"they're already having the connectivity
your net for their successfully"
connected to your network
"that mean whenever you're using just for
the computer to your you know of"
"regarding computer browsing your searching any
of the same your check your emails"
"you're sharing any of the personal
information without that have their"
"fight good chances that you know any one
of the ip adresses you can you know"
abuse your personal information and grab your personal information
and your identity
before which is active file some house
because your computer is infected because of code red
and that is the reason it is allowing all the foreign IP addresses to get into your computer
"now day by day, there might be chances that the foreign IP addresses they are going to get into your computer more and more (inaudible)"
in near future
"they also going to happen to the number
four is that this is going to you again"
"text HELP extension that is a very big
problem for you"
but there might be chances anytime your personal information
"your identity can be compromised or
anything reason the people you know they"
they can easily copy your ID and Password
"regarding your emails you can send some
of the emails to your contacts"
in your name
"now you know the other words and then
we're going to receive a mail from under"
your name
"they could you open up that mail ok now
what we're going to give it to like on"
the fake mail
their computer is also going to be connected to the same IP addresses with the same foreign IP Addresses
"other two they're using and they also
get it's not be the same problem that"
"the kind of pretend you don't see these
kind of people that doing that they can"
"it connect of the maximum normal windows
user at negative views identity at the"
false information
definitely third step over there is a
you know there is a thing we have you
"so we get some other things but right
now I want you to grab a pen and paper"
handy with you
...
take you time
"Ok, let me pull up my girlfriend on Facebook"
"OK, first of all"
you can just write down the company name which I work for
"TeqFly, T. E. Q.       F. L. Y"

"Scammer: yeah, at the back of the card, flip over the card you'll see the last three digits. Type in just the last three digits"
Jerry: yeah its 493
Scammer: ok let me just check it out
"Ok, now it says the card number is invalid"
"doo you have any other cards, Jerry, that you can use"
"Jerry: Unfortunately, this is my only card I have, it's my VISA card"
Scammer: ok

alright?
Ok so let me open a fresh new page for you
Give me a moment
*ragtime music plays*
"alright, if you can retype in the number and please double check"
"because what happens, Jerry, at times the color gets deleted from the card and you don't see the number properly (the first truthful thing he's said)"
"Aright, so please double check and please we are the error report as invalid"
"Jerry: So here, hold I think I might  have ... hold I think I might  have my credit card on my desktop in a folder I can copy and paste"

"Nope, it's not in there."

Hold on
"Yeah, I dont have it, I can try typing it in again"
"Scammer:uh yeah, one by one, very slowly"

"Jerry: you guys I work for Microsoft i'm

can you read it in Spanish please right
now there's nobody Spanish to keep toast
on your poop there's nobody - speaking
Spanish so cheaters buñol okay okay yeah
thank you
hey everybody its lon Seidman and today
I received not one but two of those scam
calls from overseas where they try to
convince you that there's something
wrong with your computer and that they
the security company needs to come in
and fix it for you which usually ends up
infecting your computer and costing you
a lot of money so what I wanted to do
though is play what one of these calls
sounds like so if you are a relative
gets the call you'll know what it is and
know not to participate in it so usually
what happens is the phone rings you pick
it up now following that what will
happen is they have you load up some
screen on your computer and in my case
he had me load up a little utility that
Windows has that only displays errors
that the system has encountered and most
of them are really minor issues nothing
even remotely to be concerned about but
they make it out to be much more than
that
okay now I see a bunch of errors and
warnings does that mean I'm hacked then
is my call progressed um I got somebody
else on the line hello who's this is
this the senior engineer yes there's
more than I can count
there's more than I can count okay
there's this one too but please don't
yell at me you're me I'm already scared
as it is you you know you have a problem
here I need to get fixed so what's the
solution yeah okay
okay I need to know how to fix this
problem what do I need to do now because
all of our computers are online and
connected to the world essentially it is
not very difficult for you to give one
of these people access to your computer
and when you do that they will log into
it and hack it right in front of you now
what'll happen is they'll say well
that's the virus that we detected
they'll take a credit card from you over
the phone charge you who knows what to
then remove the software that they just
put in or worse hang up and leave it on
there and have require you to go take it
into a service center to get repaired
which will cost even more so they are
also not the most patient souls in the
world and listen to what happened once I
got them a little riled up yeah but you
call before and you hung up on me so
what I my computer's virus there's
hackers in it or something right yeah
yeah how do we get the hackers out yeah
so what's the problem how do I get that
how do I get the hackers out of my
computer
yeah yeah let me pull it up right now
what can I do it's completely off it's
completely off right now on on okay is
there - is there - power buttons yeah
because I have it on just on but you
said on excuse me
so that is what those calls sound like
and if you get one my advice to you
would be to hang up the phone
immediately a lot of times they're able
to fake the caller ID that they're
calling from so it won't be some
overseas number it'll actually appear
like some legitimate company but what I
would do is if you really think you
might have a problem hang up that call
look up
the phone number for your internet
service provider whether it's Comcast
AT&T Frontier whoever it is pick up the
phone call that service provider on the
number that they gave you with your
service and ask them if you're having a
problem because that way you'll know
that you're calling in to the right
place and they'll have the ability to
legitimately take a look at your
connection to make sure that you do not
have anything awry going on now what I'm
going to do or after I close out the
video here is play the full length of
that call and the second one that I got
today as well it is kind of funny and I
kind of made myself out to be a little
panicked about the situation this is for
watching the internal part of my
computer what part is that
I don't understand what do you mean by
internal part of my computer yeah which
part which part is it my my floppy disk
drive or what what part is it breaking
my modem my motherboard what's that that
sounds really expensive is it is it
breaking my motherboard oh it's breaking
it yeah so how do I fix this what can
you do to help me how can how can I stop
the hackers how do I stop them all right
I can be let me let me turn it on here

[Music]
police are hunting for three men
allegedly involved in a sophisticated
multimillion-dollar phone scam that seen
"one person alone fleeced out of $300,000"
the scammers claimed to be from spark or
the police and they con victims into
handing over money or downloading
software that allows their bank accounts
to be raided remotely more than a dozen
people have already been arrested for
money laundering and what's been dubbed
Operation did what I asked detective
Sergeant Kevin Blackmon exactly how the
scam worked so you'll get someone who
will pretend that they are calling from
predominantly spark how we were not yeah
it could be any sort of telco or chorus
or something along those lines and they
say to you hey someone is trying to hack
into your your internet or someone is
trying to hack into your bank account or
someone is trying to hack into your
computer you need to act immediately and
they will seem they put on they send the
victim a link and they say you need to
click on this link so that we can stop
these people from accessing your account
and there a lot of people think that's a
gene that's something that would
generally happen so they don't actually
ask you for your bank account as such
they give an email address off you and
then send you this link a dodgy load
yeah yes I don't get you in this link as
soon as you click on this link it's you
know there's a whole lots of
applications that they can do it but the
one the main one is it's called Team
Viewer I'll send you this link you'll
click on it and as soon as you click on
it occurs the incomplete access to your
computer so then if you are doing online
banking or something similar they work
out what your passwords and things that
I said though what I'll do is I'll say
someone who's trying to access your bank
accounts and so you need to go into your
bank account and we need to you know do
something with your peg account to stop
these people actually I'm hacking in but
you know these people are actually doing
the heck in themselves have you heard
one of the conversations firsthand or
recording of it we have how convincing
are they are they very convincing these
things you know
we go to work everyday and do our jobs
and we believe these people go to work
every day and do their job their job is
scamming people so these these people
are very convincing you know they don't
take no for an answer
you can hang up on them and they'll ring
back and they'll say oh why did you hang
up on us you know you've been hacked and
a lot of people said no this was a scam
and then they've still been convinced
that um that they're being hacked how
much money are they lifting off people
here so you know we've had hundreds of
people fall victim to the scams ranging
from a few thousand to nearly three
hundred thousand dollars in one hat
three hundred grand in one hat well a
lot of the a lot of these victims will
get worked on for a period of time so
for example though I'll continually call
up every day and and it could take a
period quite a while a period of time
before the victim a she realizes that
they're being scammed
we released a media at least a few
months ago where the scammers were
saying that they were working with the
new zealand police and that they were
needing the they were using the victims
to help catch these these hackers so the
people thought they're actually helping
the new zealand please but they were
being scammed themselves that's that's
really young you know it's really scary
for us because you know the last thing
we want as people and not trusting the
police so they at 300 grand although it
might have been taken over time that
came from one victim did it yeah that's
correct okay so are these people calling
from within New Zealand or is there an
offshore element to this yeah we believe
it as being run off shore and however
there is definitely a New Zealand
element so the New Zealand base we call
them mules and the mule is someone who's
used to to transfer the money or launder
the money and it could be a number of
those and anyone in any one victim or
any one transaction so the mules in New
Zealand are being used
you saved the money and then transfer
the money predominately offshore so you
are currently you're asking for help to
locate three people tell us a little bit
about them yet we've released the names
of three people that our investigation
and I have identified are involved in
some way or another they're not the only
three but they are three that have we
currently have warrants to arrest for
money laundering in relation to the scam
and do you think they're still in the
Auckland area well we think we
definitely know they have been but I
wouldn't want to say that they are only
in the only in Auckland area you know
they do have connections throughout yeah
predominately greater North Island okay
so you say thirteen people are arrested
already you've put these three names out
into the public domain how how
widespread do you think this is how many
more people are out there
well yeah people are getting people
getting scanned over the whole country
and we we think that there are people
that have been used to launder the money
it's way more than what we were is to
put it that way you know and in every
one who's receiving money from these
victims are putting themselves out there
for charges of money laundering so you
can't just have money turned up in your
account and just pretend you don't know
anything about it you know you are
responsible for your own account you
have there are rules and regulations
around the use of your account you can't
be given your if postcard someone else
and pretending you don't know anything
about it you know in a few so if you
receive money in your account and you
don't notify your bank or come to the
police and say hey look I've just had
"$10,000 pop up in my account what's the"
story the new at risk of being charged
with money laundering and is that what
is happening are these people using
associates to launder money there's a
range of different things so there's
associates you know that the some some
of people that we're looking at have
used their own account
yes so it's just there's a number of
different ways that it can happen I see
that you note that these three guys that
you were looking for have been knowing
to frequents the casino is their money
laundering going on through through
gambling as well well unfortunately the
casino you know we're working quite
closely of the casino and I've been
really good so you can withdraw large
amounts of money from the casino so you
know that is one of the places that
people go to the straw was called case
not necessarily to gamble with it but to
to ask Lauren launder it so these three
that you're looking for are they New
Zealand residents or citizens no they're
not they are Indian nationals that are
here on various visas but we are working
with film Gration in relation to the
scheme as well and there's Detective
Sergeant Kevin Blackmon details of the
three men that police are looking for
are on the police website and Facebook
page

don't fall for
[Applause]
all right do you constantly get those
annoying robo calls we all do right
sometimes they're from telemarketers but
in many cases they're actually from
scammers as 3 on your side's Gary Harper
explains there's one particular call you
don't want to fall for well as far as we
can tell this phone scam we're talking
about has been around for at least 1012
years and it died down for a while but
as you're about to see it is back in
full swing senior citizens are one of
the most targeted groups around when it
comes to scams and now there seems to be
an uptick in the number of scam calls
that seniors are getting reportedly from
the Social Security Administration four
digits of your social security number
when you call to better assist you with
this issue the call can be pretty
intimidating and they tricked many
senior citizens into returning the
scammers phone call they usually bait
the person further by claiming their
social security number is about to be
suspended or that their social security
checks will be stopped the Federal Trade
Commission reports that since January of
"2018 there have been more than 63,000"
reports of the Social Security scam call
and get this crooks have made off with
more than 16 million dollars from
seniors who called back and divulged
personal information the average loss
for a senior citizen is right around
"1,500 bucks they're definitely making"
people feel threatened Felicia Thompson
is with the Phoenix Better Business
Bureau her organization has seen an
increase in complaints regarding these
scam calls and continue to track them on
a daily basis three on your side has
also received a spike in the number of
concerned viewers asking of the calls
are legitimate remember they're not
because the Social Security
Administration will not call you if they
do need to correspond with you it's very
likely if they're gonna send a letter
versus making a phone call and they they
will actually want consumers to know
that they don't make those threatening
calls that these scammers are pretending
to do these scammers usually threaten
you with arrest warrants or tell you
that your social security checks will be
temporarily stopped if you don't call
them back it's all just a ploy though to
dupe you out of your money

all delicious a pecan battle let's
cockadoodle luck a dr. Askari sir thank
you a surgeon Herman good afternoon
everyone thank you for your presence
here today we have an important
announcement regarding recent
developments and significant to trust
disruption efforts resulting from our
investigation into the infamous Canada
Revenue Agency telemarketing tax scam
for anyone unaware this particular scam
occurs over the phone by email or by
text message a call or send or calmly
from India posing as an agent from the
CRE attempts to gather personal
information or intimidate a victim into
providing financial payment too many of
our fellow Canadians have fallen victim
to scam and a foresee loss to hurt
earned Oh plenty more have been affected
not to mention bothered and harassed
it's true this incessant trickery has
pervaded too long but we continue to
fight back and we're making progress
the RCMP takes threats to economic
integrity very seriously and has been
engaged in ongoing complex
investigations since reports of the CRA
scam have increased and financial losses
began we built the collaborative efforts
and working relationships with Indian
authorities and other international
partners to identify mass marketing
fraud call centers that perpetuate the
scam and others in 2008 as reports of
financial losses started to spike we
recognized as harmful scam was affecting
everyone to Canada with a cell phone a
landline or internet connection
something more had to be done under the
project name
octavia and led by the RCMP Greater
Toronto
area financial crime section we grew our
investigative capacity to national scope
with the best investigative points of
contact in every RCMP Division and
connections to police throughout Ontario
our RCMP liaison officer in India became
more heavily engaged and working with
our Indian authorities US authorities
there we since seen successes in
disruption and takedown of illegal call
centers in India and arrests and charges
in her own country reported a lawsuit
CRE scam in 2018 went down significantly
most likely thanks to these efforts
we'll get into specifics and details of
a recent disruption and a forcement
effort shortly but first I'd like to
emphasize how public awareness is key
strategy in preventing the victimization
of Canadians and combating fraud Dee
RCMP works closely with government and
domestic and international law
enforcement partners to raise awareness
share best practices of these types of
crimes we are joint operator of the
Canadian anti-fraud centre who routinely
issues educational bulletins provides
scam alerts and has developed
partnerships with financial institutions
telephone companies and courier
companies we and our partners are
working hard to help increase awareness
and vigilance and need you to help
spread the word to no one is immune to
fraud but you can protect yourself and
others by learning how to recognize
reject and report it remember if someone
on the phone is asking for your personal
or banking information hang up and
report the activity to the Canadian
anti-fraud centre if the caller is
threatening you or your family hang up
and contact the local police if you
receive an email or a text message
making suspicious tax claims and urging
you to click on a link to submit
information don't interact and report
the occurrence to the Canadian
anti-fraud centre I'll now turn the mic
back over to sergeant Herrmann thank you

sir
good afternoon everyone
thank you so much Sergent Herman in
October 2018 to the RCMP Greater Toronto
Area financial crime section commenced
an investigation named project Octavia
the focus of the investigation was to
combat the Canada Revenue Agency
telemarketing tax scam better known as
the CRA scam the scam involves callers
identifying themselves as CRA RCMP or
other federal government agencies and
then intimidating victims into paying
non-existent fines for taxes the CRA
scam which is operating out of India has
been targeting the Canadian public since
2014 and despite a number of police
raids on illegal call centers in India
it continues to victimize Canadians
cumulatively between 2014 and 2019 the
CRA scam has resulted in repeated or
reported victim losses totaling over
seventeen point two million dollars the
scam has caused fear due to the threat
of arrest by the fraudsters who claim to
be from various government Canadian
government agencies this is meant that
Canadians are weary and suspicious even
when CRA is attempting legitimate
contact with them RCMP investigators
have uncovered money mules or money mule
managers operating in Canada who assist
with laundering of funds obtained
through C the CRA scam and other scams
this money mule network operates across
various provinces in Canada with
connections to illegal call centres in
India who are receiving the proceeds of
the scams on Wednesday February the 12th
project Octavia investigators arrested
and charged two people in connection to
these Transnet
scams including the CRA scam the bank
investigator scam and the tech support
scam Gurinder Preet dolly well I'll
spell the last name D H al I wal 37
years of age from Brampton Ontario and
inderpreet dolly well I'll spell the
last name again D H al I wal 36 years of
age also from Brampton are charged with
the following criminal offences one
count of fraud over $5000 one count of
laundering the proceeds of crime and one
count of property obtained by crime in
addition to this a Canada wide arrest
warrant has been issued to Santa new
Manek I'll spell the last name ma n I K
26 years of age who was a foreign
national believed to be in India further
arrests and charges may result from this
investigation we remain steadfast in our
pursuit the arrest of Canadian based
co-conspirators is significant
we have disrupted the necessary flow of
money from Canada to India which will
have a big impact on the operation and
the bond of blood at the bottom line of
the scammers we know that are the
efforts of the RCMP have the efforts
that we put into combating the scam has
had an impact in 2018 reported losses to
the scam totaled 6.4 million dollars
since October 2018 when project Octavia
efforts began including a robust public
awareness and Prevention campaign the
takedown of 39 illegal call centers in
Noida and New Delhi areas within India
and enforcement activities here these
arrests and charges
those reported losses to the CRA scam in
2019 were down significantly to 1.4
million dollars as a result of our
investigation Aleph Ertz I would like to
thank the following for their assistance
in the successful outcome of project
Octavia the Canadian anti-fraud centre

the Indian Central Bureau of
Investigation and US authorities that

fraudsters I can assure you that the
RCMP will continue to fulfill its
mandate of pursuing criminality that

solid operationally cream organized a
transnational we will now open the floor
for some questions the Salomon topaz a
question
so can you sorry before we continue
you
the two people that I spoke about that
are both from Brampton our husband and
wife
Colin freeze the globe mail can you
explain why do they need mules in Canada
money moves electronic electronically
these days so what was what was the role
of the Mules specifically that you're
alleging the roles of the mules was to
receive packages of the contained cash
Canadian cash and then forward that the
contents of that package as instructed
to do so
and thereby money laundering and send
the funds sending the funds somewhere
else okay just just supplemental the it
strikes me in a Canada white scam there
could be more meals out there you've got
you to custody an arrest warrant for a
third are there in fact more meals out
there and if so why why you winding down
project Octavia at this juncture let me
be clear we're not winding down project
Octavia
we still have others that we are
pursuing and and those that have come
forward as money mules in some cases
what we have done is we've taken
statements from them if they have been
here on student visas or something like
that then we also refer them their names
to Canada Border Services Agency for
their action which may mean pulling the
student visas and deporting them back to
whatever country they had come from last
question there was a report last month
that the RCMP Oh division is rolling up
its Financial Crimes Unit I'm just
wondering if that's true if your jobs
are changing and if so what does that
mean for the prosecution and
investigation of crimes such as these
good afternoon I can assure you that we
are not stopping financial crime
investigations within Ontario what has
been reported to clarify is we're
actually restructuring or structure
within the RCMP within Ontario to merge
our financial crime investigators with
our serious and organised crime
investigators we're looking for
efficiencies looking for mechanisms to
improve our way of doing business
especially as it relates to
transnational organized crime so I can
assure you that we're not stopping doing
financial crime if anything we hope to
even become better at doing it
Sean O'Shay reporter with global news in
Toronto for either the superintendent or
the inspector you're having a big press
conference here and you're announcing
two arrests what kind of a dent are you
saying that these arrests are going to
put into what is a significant
multi-million dollar problem is this it
or is this a significant part of it
could you clarify that please it's not
it it is what we've done to be clear is
significant in that when we started our
investigation we we had intended on
educating the public public awareness
prevention those sorts of things as well
as utilizing information and
intelligence from the Canadian
anti-fraud centre and then informing our
ello in India to allow him to work with
Indian authorities the Central Bureau of
Investigation there as well as US
authorities that are based in India to
disrupt and take down some of these
illegal call centers what we had hoped
to do was be able to stop anything that
was happening here in Canada and this is
a big step that we've been able to take
to actually find Canadians that are
involved as money mules or money mule
managers and forwarding the scheme and
so to be clear when I had said earlier
that in 2018 it was 6.4 million
in the CRA scam I believe that we've
made a dent because that number went
down to 1.4 million for 2019 certainly
they evolved the scam and try other ones
but it's through that education piece
and one of the things that
superintendent Payne had spoken about
we're hoping that we can continue to
inform Canadians and educate Canadians
so that they don't fall victim to to
these scams follow what percentage are
you alleging that this husband and wife
in Brampton were responsible for when it
comes to the CRA scam you also allude to
the bank inspector scam of the tech
repair scam i I don't have that
information to to provide you with and a
final supplementary or Canadians still
going to get these phone calls as a
result of your arrests in your action so
far I would like to say that they would
not get those phone calls but I expect
that they will continue as I had just
said earlier they continually to
continue to evolve the scam you're
certainly if you've got a cell phone a
landline you're getting calls
essentially related to the service
canada scam and thus in number scam
we're doing our best to do whatever we
can to to stop it and our efforts will
continue it seems as though there were
five charges each to each person
arrested i'm three charges to each three
charges it seems like a low number or
low amount of charges considering the
amount of money involved in the amount
of the number of victims can you clarify
why I certainly can so certainly you
could choose to charge each individual
with separate counts these are global
counts or global charges to cover off
everything that we're alleging that they
have done hi Natalie didn't ask you with
CBC so CBC actually did an investigation
into the CRA scam and found that there
were about sixty thousand Canadians who
complained a lot of these actually gave
money and you said that it was 17 point
two million dollars over a course of
five years what is the RCMP doing to
recoup that money because if my
understanding is a lot of these people
gave away
life savings correct unfortunately we
were not in we're not able to recruit
recoup those funds I can tell you though
in some cases I had spoken earlier about
money mules that we're here in Canada
that we're either willing or
unintentional unintentional participants
with some of those we were actually able
to get some victims money back and repay
them that is doesn't happen it's not a
high percentage of course but I go back
to what I said earlier and just
educating the public as best as we can
to stop to hang up to do what Peter had
said earlier recognize reject hang up
and then report have any of those money
mules been arrested or charged and if
not how come some money mules have have
not been charged the reason for that
would be to further whether or not we
had enough evidence to actually charge
them but also we gain valuable
information from them that we were able
to to use for our investigation in those
cases some of those cases we have
referred their names to CB sa so that
they may be you know deported or student
visas cancelled things like that
the couple charged here can you give us
a few examples of some of the things
that they were doing here on the ground
and how they were sort of running this
network I'll do as much as I can without
affecting the the charges that are that
we've laid on those particular
individuals but essentially what was
happening was victims were receiving
phone calls from the Indian call center
and they would be directed to send money
in envelopes and then have it couriered
to a particular address and a name that
they had been
given those names and addresses ended up
being those that have been charged and
so that's essentially the the process
that they've they've utilized I was
going to do this later but you can see
there's a chart over to my right up
against the wall that shows essentially
project octavia x' scam the flowchart of
the money as well as the information
that goes back and forth from the call
centers to the victim and then onward to
the money meals could you talk a little
bit about the circumstances of the
arrest here how did you bring these
people down we we essentially attended
their locations and and then made
arrests as as safely as we could with
certainly with officer safety in mind
although there was no concerns we we
also want to make sure that we're
protecting our officers when arrests are
made so it was at a particular work site
for the for mr. Dhaliwal for mrs. Dawley
well we we called her and asked her to
turn us into to our detachment here
across the street and she did that and
all the items that are off to the side
here were these all seized as a result
of this arrest these arrests correct so
the address is that people being scammed
were sunny was it just to their home or
did they have like sort of drop points
were they all the same address in some
cases that's drop points in other in
other cases it's directly to their
residence did you describe this as a
sophisticated system that they were
using or was it fairly rudimentary I
think it's fairly rudimentary although
the sophistication is essentially from
all of the technology that that has been
created the voice over Internet Protocol
the number spoofing all of those things
have certainly helped the robocalling
all of that helps
and provide some level of legitimacy to
them calling victims and making them
think that they're either CRA or the
RCMP or other federal government
agencies does this relate to a
prosecution that's just concluded in
Texas an individual named Patel who is
alleged to run these things in India and
has been prosecuted by the US Department
of Justice it does not directly relate
but the scam is similar milena shake
City News what was the total value of
funds and goods taken from the couple
charged as you'll see on the table to my
"right there was $26,000 in Canadian cash"
that was seized there was also a money
counting machine that was seized
there were also packages that were used
to received victims money that we have
on the table over there you'll also
notice on the left hand side there's a
there's jewelry that's on the table with
an appraised value of a hundred and
fourteen thousand dollars
so these these are mules they're not the
the kingpins but they would they would
get a cut basically you're alleging them
of what the network in India would get
we believe that to be the case we're not
entirely sure just what those
percentages may be can you talk about
the call centers in India I think a lot
of people when you hear call centers
think of a big place with you know lots
of going on where they sit that's
sophisticated or are these just you know
a few people sort of sitting around I my
understanding from some of those call
centers and it's some from some of the
same things that Canadians have seen on
on the CBC marketplace episodes that
have been aired but they can be as small
as 6 to 12 individuals that are working
out of these particular call centers
we've done a lot of stories on this
issue and could you comment please from
your perspective on the kinds of victims
who are falling victim a lot of people
say I'd never fall for that how could
somebody be so fill in the blank what
did you find through your investigation
on the kind of victims who have fallen
to this particular scam as well as the
bank inspector scan and the tech fix
scam one of the things that was a bit of
a surprise to me I expected that it
wouldn't be a cross-section of all
Canadians or I expected that it might be
seniors new immigrants things like that
but what we have certainly seen evidence
of from the stats that we've received
from the Canadian anti-fraud centre is
that it goes across the board so let's
say you're a person who just hasn't paid
their CRA debt that they may have
incurred or they haven't filed taxes
then if they get a call from an Indian
call center they may think that that is
a legitimate call so it could be anyone
from whether or not they'd be you know
young or old you said earlier that the
total amount lost was sort of twelve
point seven million dollars
/ since 2014 are you alleging that this
couple is responsible for that entire
amount or are there other people out
there who are doing the same sort of
scams I'm certainly not alleging that
this couple has done that I think the
number that I gave you for this cieariy
scam from 2014 on word was 17 point 2
million when we look at the bank
investigator scam as well as the tech
scam those numbers climbed from 2014 up
to 31 million dollars yes there's many
others that are doing this to the
current criminal penalties that apply
here provide enough of a disincentive to
organized crime that would undertake
exactly what we're talking about here I
certainly hope so
"the penalty for fraud over $5,000 is is"
14 years imprisonment for the other two
charges that I had mentioned it's 10
years imprisonment do either of the
accused have a criminal record not to my
knowledge you mentioned there's an
arrest warrant out for an Indian
national what's the likelihood do you do
you have any you know expectation that
that person might be brought to justice
one day my hope is that that would
happen one of the things that we can do
is is request a red notice which is
essentially an international arrest
warrant and then provide that
information to the Indian authorities
and asked them to locate arrest and and
we would then extradite this this person
back to Canada to face the charges India
is not going to extradite one of its own
people to Canada Forex traditions we
would pay the cost for those things so
it would it would depend of whether or
not there was a red notice and whether
whether we would go ahead with that it's
not our decision it would be the
decision of the crown
okay that that will conclude our
interviews for now we'll move on to the
one-on-one interviews now see that's

you
their scam calls plenty of us have
received before with the person on the
other line saying they're worth a Canada
Revenue Agency in that you owe thousands
of dollars in taxes but now there's this
mystery man who has taken it upon
himself to put those calls to an end and
get this yes they have Canadians
millions of dollars collectively
here I'm hoping you just hung up on
those revenue scammers did you oh my god
this man from southwestern Ontario who
asked not to be identified refers to
himself as Devon he says this is audio
of one of the hundreds of scam calls
he's intercepted will you tell me you
didn't give them any money no I didn't
good I don't know you're getting attempt
at something illegal is going on not to
mention the devastating effects it has
on people when they lose you know
literally tens if not hundreds of
thousands of dollars about a year ago
Devon received one of those scam calls
himself he said he befriended the man on
the other end of the call who happened
to work at a call center in India and
that man is now Devon's informant the
information and the arrangement that we
had was every time you say something
super tip we would get money as kind of
an incentive for him to continue with us
the man since Devon names and numbers of
people about to give money to the
fraudsters Devon then attempts to
intercept the transaction by calling the
would-be victim non-stop until he gets
through if he does he pays his informant
100 dollars out of his own pocket hold
this woman she is so being scammed right
now this is a recording of one of those
calls the tipsters voice has been
altered because of concerns for his
safety
he's something too right now as we speak
hopefully you can get it stopped because
she's in the process of putting the
money into the machine the instant
gratification is worth the money so once
you get hooked on it you're just waiting
for the next one the next one the next
one the next one in terms of why he does
it Devon says it's hard not to he tried
to stop in the past but consistently
receive multiple
today which makes it difficult to walk
away coming up we'll have more on how
much money Canadians are being scammed
out of and if you like more on my
conversation with Devin just use your
phone aim it at the code at the bottom
of your screen that will take you to a
link to our website City news dot CA
[Music]
earlier we told you the story of a man
named Devin who has taken it upon
himself to stop CRA scams from happening
as the transaction is about to take
place his only motivation to keep your
hard-earned cash in your pockets about a
year ago Devin received one of those
scam calls himself he said he befriended
the man on the other end who happened to
work at a call center in India that man
is now Devin's informant the information
and the arrangement that we had was
every time we say something super tip we
would get money as kind of an incentive
for him to continue with us
the man sends Devin names and numbers of
people about to give money to the
fraudsters Devin then attempts to
intercept the transaction by calling the
would-be victim not stop until he gets
through if he does he pays his informant
$100 out of his own pocket oldest woman
she first saw being scammed right now
it's happening too right now as we speak
hopefully you can get it stopped because
she's in the process of putting the
money into the machine
Toronto Police Financial detective
Michael Strang verified Devin's story
saying he has worked with him on a
couple of cases Strang called them
exceptional career highlights being able
to stop a crime as it's taking place in
real time we were able to intervene and
prevent that from happening so a lot of
these cases we hear about them after the
fact this was a particularly compelling
case in that we were able to prevent
that and it was it was for me it was one
of those highlight days one case
involved someone in Victoria BC about to
"be hustled out of $60,000 the other was"
a young University student in Toronto
who almost lost her entire tuition I've
never met him we've got an email
relationship but I'm quite thankful that
I was I was able to intervene and help
out and I was quite thankful for him
for doing what he does according to the
Canadian anti-fraud centre the amount of
Canadians falling victim to telephone
"scams are down last year over 22,000"
people reported complaints of that
"number 1,400 revised in total losing"
over 6 million dollars so far this year
of substantial decrease of 451 reported
victims of fraud collectively losing
"over 1 million $300,000 but officials"
say the frequency of the calls seemingly
have gotten worse due to the increase of
tech devices unfortunately the world's
become a small place and we're
vulnerable to everywhere so the way we
help ourselves is community and and
communication with each other as for
Devin in an attempt to educate the
public he has developed a website in
hopes of exposing phone numbers
associated with scammers so far there
are over 1000 numbers listed for more on
my conversation with Devin just use your

ATP scammers are using the
utility company trying to get
your hard earned money in
tonight's better call 4
Jennifer Bullock has a closer
look at these fraudulent phone
calls Jen a Brad and Darlene
you get a phone call from
someone claiming to be with a P
telling you to pay up or lose
power. That's exactly what
happened to a Columbus man but
he called better call 4 and I
called the power company to ask
about these fake phone calls
and how you should respond.
There's never an immediate
threat behind a disconnection
that is something you does not
do that warning from American
Electric power as scammers
target its customers we are
aware that scammers are
reaching out to customers in a
multiple different ways phone
calls emails and sometimes even
showing up in person.
Joseph highest called better
call 4 after getting a call
from a Columbus area number an
automated message claiming to
be from a P told him his
service would be disconnected
and he would lose power in the
next 30 minutes unless he acted
immediately by pressing one you
press one.
Then a man comes on the
phone what that man didn't know
is that Joseph isn't an ATP
customer. I don't even have a
place.
And I'm staying at a hotel.
You know the phone immediately.
Then Joseph called ATP who
says it is aware of the scam
this is a very common scam
"unfortunately, that happens to"
our customers we certainly the
Ohio that there was a way that
we could stop that from
happening that's why Schmidt
says it's important for you to
know how to respond properly if
you receive one of these calls
first hang up then if you are a
customer go directly to the
source and check on your
account status to make sure the
information you're being told
is accurate if it's not and you
believe the call to be
fraudulent call the utility
company and let a
representative now we rely on
our customers to provide that
information to let us know
where the scams are happening
and how they're happening so we
can get that education out to
our customers.
Now I also asked how ATP is
handling the concerns of
customers during the pandemic
because we received a lot of
calls. Many worried about this
connection because they're
still waiting to receive
benefits under behind on
payments will he says the
company is willing to work with
each customer individually
adding that there are also
programs available to help and
I'm details on those programs
it's a busy time of year and like many
people Georgina Perez barely has time to
take a break
yesterday in the middle of all the chaos
she got a phone call someone from
Citizenship and Immigration telling her
that she'd failed to file a document
with the Mexican Consulate if she didn't
pay a fine she would have to go to court
and possibly face deportation the key
words that stayed in my head throughout
the whole conversation is pay the 2500
Oh we'll deport you
the caller gave his badge number the
call display showed an actual
immigration office phone number for the
first 40 minutes I thought it was legit
and I was scared so she stalled and was
able to reach an actual immigration
officer on her cell phone who told her
it was all a scam Perez says a fraud so
elaborate must be profitable if they get
so good at this
how much time are they putting into it
and and I don't know how many people
they already got money from Toronto
police say she's right she's not alone
they get daily complaints about
fraudsters posing as government
employees victimizing those going
through the immigration process these
groups will actually go through Canada
for one one or a phone books looking for
ethnic last names and in the off chance
that when they call one of these ethnic
last names they actually are in the
immigration system Perez wanted her
story out hoping to help others
especially with an influx of refugees on
the way she's worried others could be
easily duped there was somebody who
doesn't understand English very well or
someone who's being here for less time
and for sure if they were close to a
deportation they will do anything
Citizenship and Immigration tell the CBC
that they don't call clients asking that
fines be paid in order to avoid
deportation and what's more they don't
accept payment by prepaid credit card or
private money transfers and if anyone
calls asking for that it's likely a scam
filthy shinnok CBC News Toronto
they know that people make bad decisions
when they feel scared new scam calls
making the rounds in Greater Cleveland
some of those callers even threatening
to arrest you
our Tara Molina brought one of those
calls to the FTC today and Tara they say
they are investigating these now
thousands of them robbed which is why
we're out here sharing this message with
everyone today so that maybe you don't
answer the phone when one of these
scammers called
and mistakenly give away your personal
information one does get expired after
that you will be taken under customers
like a local [ __ ] just one of the calls
going around right now
they gave 24 hours so they're creating a
sense of urgency I brought it to the
Federal Trade Commission again they know
that people make poor decisions when
they feel rushed and John Steiger told
me it used to be that the telemarketers
were just calling to get money they
would do whatever they needed to do in
order to get you to send them scammers
like this one there are four serious
allegations aren't always looking for
what you'd think well nowadays a lot of
us know information can be sold in fact
these Robo callers can get a lot from a
little even when you just answer the
phone you're giving them some
information you're giving them the
information that this is a working
telephone number and so they can take
that and sell that the more information
you give in a call the more money the
telemarketer can get maybe that's why
when we called back from a station phone
in there threatening 24-hour window we
got this we're sorry your call cannot be
completed at this time some of the calls
going around right now have duped West
Lake Police Department's phone number or
other Greater Cleveland police
departments so that's how it appears on
caller ID that's not gonna happen that's
not the way that a legitimate police
department will work but the advice the
FTC is giving now is different than what
you may have heard in the past or back
when you put your number on the federal
Do Not Call list to not answer the phone
if it's someone important they can leave
a message
can then decide what to do whether
you're going to call back now the FCC
has a database of many of these numbers
that they are adding to and publishing
daily it's really a great resource if
you're iffy about a missed call that
you've got on your phone right now but
they're asking that anyone who receives
any spam call report that to them you
can do that easily online we're over the
phone I put all the information on how
to on our website and our News 5 app
reporting live in Cleveland I'm Tara

hey guys we've been busy in the field
the last few days and I just had a story
here well I'm bouncing down the road in
the combine from one field to another
first off I am making a video today so
I'm hoping if I can get home suited up
tonight I can take an hour and create
that video and get that online for you
guys but this was too good not to share
so I'm combining earlier today back and
forth Crossfield minding my own business
and I get a text message from a phone
number that I have never heard of before
I have no idea where this number came
from and it reads
hello good date here is captain Jeffrey
John sounds important I will like to
know if you still render tree service
and please do you accept credit card as
a form of payment
if yes kindly get back to me
to which I respond greetings captain
indeed I do still render tree service
how may I be of assistance to you
captain says thanks for getting back to
me I just got a new house here in the
state and I want to get rid of all trees
and stumps in the house but currently
I'm out of state for a special military
base and I will like the job done before
am back please do you accept credit
cards
[Music]
and please what is your merchant
processor because PayPal and squared is
not remembered my card here is the house
address then he goes on to list an
address it's about ten miles away from
me in a small town I look the address up
it's a legit address of a house that's
actually for sale and wouldn't you know
they have an awful lot of grown up
shrubs and trees in their yard
so of course I respond back captain
beautiful place Congrats the estimate is
"$7,500 I'm on my way there now to start"
removing trees are you from the area
no I just got the house how do you
process your card well this guy would
really like my processing information so
I told them I'll get you the credit card
info tonight I'm busy cutting the trees
right now whose trees my trees yes yours
you are not supposed to do that he said
so I weighed in about 15 20 minutes
and I sent him this the police are here
I told them you are captain but they
still seem very upset can I give them
your number he didn't respond so I
waited another 10 minutes and I told him
hello
captain Jeffrey John please answer the
police when they call you they're very
upset with me for doing my job they're
considering hanging me and I have
children
please just explain to them that you're
a captain and then I will go back to
work removing your trees that was about
half an hour ago and he has texted me
eight more times
wondering where I'm at and he would like
me to message with him he's been trying
to come he's been trying to call me and
I haven't decided if I'm going to take
the phone call or not
but it's coming from this number so it's
him I've clearly got him in panic mode
feel too bad for them so I haven't
decided if I'm gonna answer that phone
call yet or not but anyway this story
was too good not to share with you guys
this is the kind of entertainment that I
need when I'm driving back and forth and
a combine all day
and that's all I got
LORI:
A NUMBER OF GOVERNMENT AGENCIES
HAVE ISSUED WARNINGS
RECENTLY ABOUT SCAMS RELATED TO
THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.
"TONIGHT, WATE SIX ON YOUR SIDE"
CONSUMER REPORTER DON
DARE
TALKS WITH A COUPLE WHO
RECEIVED A CALL RECENTLY ABOUT
AN EXPENSIVE VIRUS TEST.
DON:
"LORI, THE COST WAS 400 DOLLARS."
"HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO REAL"
"TEST BEING OFFERED. THE CALLS,"
THERE WERE TWO OF
"THEM, WERE BOTH BOGUS IN THIS"
"CASE, THE SCAMMERS WERE TAKING"
ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION
"THE COUNTRY IS IN, THE PANDEMIC."
"ALSO, THEY WERE ADDING PRESSURE"
AND HOPING FOR A QUICK DECISION.
PHONE RINGS
TWO CALLS WERE MADE EARLIER THIS
WEEK TO ANNIE AND C.M. THEY
ASKED
WE NOT REVEAL THEIR LAST NAME.
THE FIRST CAME IN THE MORNING
FROM
A STEVE NELSON.
ANNIE: HE LEFT A MESSAGE SAYING
THAT I WAS SET UP TO
GET A VIRUS TEST. IT WOULD BE
399 DOLLARS. AND I NEEDED TO
GET THAT DONE BECAUSE I WOULD BE
CHARGED FOR IT. DARE: WHEN STEVE
NELSON LEFT YOU THAT FIRST
"MESSAGE,"
YOU WERE CURIOUS OR FRIGHTENED?
"ANNIE: I WAS FRIGHTENED, 399"
DOLLARS. ANNIE: I THOUGHT MY
GOODNESS. I DIDN'T THINK WE HAD
TO TAKE A TEST. ONLY IF
WE WANTED TO TAKE ONE. I THOUGHT
IT WAS ALL FREE THAT WE GO
SOMEWHERE HERE IN TOWN AND GET
IT.
ANNIE SAYS A SECOND CALL FROM
THE SAME NUMBER WAS MADE IN THE
AFTERNOON.
ANNIE: THE NEXT GUY WAS DAVID
PARKER.
HE SAID THAT HE WAS THE MANAGER
"OF THIS COMPANY. AND, I DID"
HAVE TO
"TAKE A VIRUS TEST, I NEEDED TO"
GET
OVER THERE AND GET IT DONE. IT
"WOULD BE 399 DOLLARS, HE"
WOULD BE SENDING ME A BILL. I
WOULD
HAVE TO PAY IT WHETHER I TOOK
THE TEST OR NOT. DARE: YOU WERE
GOING TO BE CHARGED WHETHER
YOU TOOK IT OR NOT? ANNIE: YES.
NOW HE SAID YOU HAVE TO CALL
RIGHT AWAY IF YOU WANT TO
"CANCEL,"
BUT YOU WILL HAVE TO PAY THE 399
DOLLARS.>
DARE CM WHEN YOU HEARD THAT
SECOND CALL?
"C.M., ANNIE'S HUSBAND: I'VE"
NEVER HEARD OF A FOLLOW UP CALL
ABOUT THE SAME THING. ONE GUY
"CALLS YOU, THEN"
THREE OR FOUR HOURS LATER
ANOTHER GUY CALLS AND SAYS
THAT HE IS THE MANAGER OF THIS
PLACE AND YOU HAVE TO
PAY THIS ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. <
DARE: YOU DID NOT CALL. ANNIE:
"NO, I DID NOT CALL, I CALLED THE"
POLICE.
WE CALLED THE NUMBER PROVIDED BY
THE SCAMMERS.
VOICE ON PHONE: THE TEXT MAIL
SUBSCRIBER YOU TRIED
"TO REACH IS NOT AVAILABLE,"
PLEASE LEAVE YOUR MESSAGE
AFTER THE TONE.
TONY BINKLEY: ALL THESE PEOPLE
WANT ONE THING. THEY
WANT YOUR MONEY
AT THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU
TONY BINKLEY SAYS HE'S NOT
SURPRISED ABOUT THE VIRUS
RELATED SCAM.
A REPORT RELEASED TODAY
BY FORBES - A LEADING BUSINESS
MAGAZINE -- SHOWS A HUGE
RISE IN THE TYPE OF HOAX THAT
ALMOST CAUGHT ANNIE AND CM AND
HAS LIKELY COST OTHERS A LOT OF
MONEY.
TONY BINKLEY: THERE'S BEEN OVER
"116,000 NEWLY FORMED"
"WEBSITES, NEWLY CREATED WEBSITES"
THAT ARE CORONA
VIRUS CREATED SO FAR THIS YEAR.
"OF THOSE, 40-THOUSAND OF THEM"
"ARE HIGH RISK AND 2,000 ARE"
MALICIOUS.
"ABOUT THE CALLS SHE RECEIVED,"
ANNIE HAS A SIMPLE MESSAGE.
ANNIE: IF THEY TELL YOU THAT YOU
"HAVE TO PAY, DON'T DO IT,"
DON'T DO IT.
DON:
BOTH THE FBI AND THE FEDERAL
TRADE COMMISSION HAVE REPORTED
COVID-19 RELATED SCAMS.
THEY WARN THAT ONE PROMOTES
"BOGUS CURES FOR THE VIRUS,"
ANOTHER SELLS HEALTH RELATED
"INSURANCE, AND ONE SCAM OFFERS"
"FREE HOME TESTING KITS, BUT"
TO BE ELIGIBLE YOU FIRST HAVE TO
PROVIDE PERSONAL INFORMATION.
THE BOTTOM LINE IS DON'T RESPOND
TO CALLS OR MESSAGES IN
"WHICH YOU ARE ASKED TO ""SHARE"""
YOUR PERSONAL OR FINANCIAL
INFORMATION.
LORI.
LORI:
AND ALSO REMEMBER THAT SCAMMERS
OFTEN SPOOF PHONE
"NUMBERS, MAKING THEM APPEAR AS"
IF THEY ARE EITHER LOCAL OR FROM
"WASHINGTON, D.C."
THE IDEA IS TO TRICK YOU INTO
ANSWERING OR RESPONDING.

I designed this machine to win the jackpot
everytime on our kid games like these where you have to hit the button at the exact moment the light comes by
So the plan was for me to be a hero amongst my buddies and a veritable Chuckie Cheese Robin Hood giving out free tickets to all
"The little kids, but that's not"
What actually happened
it actually turned out way more interesting and the more I tested the more
I realized this was turning into a repeat of when I use physics to expose the rigged carnival games because by building this super precise
Little robot I discovered arcade games like this are pretending to be one thing when in fact
They're total scams. now in order to explain just how bad they're scamming you let me first explain how my machine works and then walk
through the results of our testing for the past two months
Fundamentally the way this works is you have a photoresistor right here
And it senses the light five or six lights
Upstream of where you need to hit the button to get a jackpot and then after a pre-programmed delay the plunger comes down and hits
The button. To build this my buddy John
And I started by designing the main base in CAD and then we 3D printed it overnight
And then we attached the photoresistor at the end of the articulating arm
And then we took a solenoid with a plunger and attached it to the base
It's powered by 20 volts worth of double-A batteries
And this is the same power pack I use to trigger the Super Soaker and the brains of the operation
Is this wireless Arduino board and it connects via Wi-Fi to a
Super ghetto app that we made an app is critical because it lets you adjust the delay between
Sensing the light and pushing the plunger so if you miss short
You just add a few milliseconds to the delay and try again
And then to disguise the whole thing we put it in a backpack and cut a hole in the bottom so the plunger could access
the big button on the machine
So to set it up. You simply walk in set the backpack down and then pull out your phone like you're checking dankmemes
as you can see the disguise worked really well
And no one ever suspected anything. so at this point. We were ready for our first real-world test and the results were disappointing
"We were getting jackpots, but only about every 30 tries, and what was so frustrating is we got the timing dialed in so well"
we would miss short by one light and then not adjust the timing at all and then the very next run we
This long by one light. So for 30 attempts without changing anything about half were missing one light short and the other half were missing
"One light long so this could mean only one of two things, either we had some errors in our machine"
that was introducing some variability or there was something shady going on with the game itself
And troubleshooting because things don't go as planned is
incredibly common with doing any engineering task so to fix it you have to
Systematically do some detective work to figure out where the error is coming from. In the last interview Carl Sagan ever gave
He said science is more than a body of knowledge
It's a way of thinking
so here was our thought process and if I can prove that my
Machine was super precise then the only reason we weren't getting a jackpot would be because the game was rigged so I needed to start
By looking at any potential sources of variability error in my machine there were only three
so it could be the
Photoresistor the solenoid or the arduino. There was one
External source we considered and that was light pollution from all the flashing lights in the arcade could mean the input to the light sensor
Was too noisy and therefore not repeatable now
There's a trick when it comes to troubleshooting where you test several?
"Potential error sources at the same time, and if I can get really precise results within this loop"
Then I know that none of those components are the source of the error without having to take time to test each individually
so to test all three of these at once we made a simple app that flashed a white screen and started a stopwatch at the
Exact same time and then we set the trigger for exactly one second later and sure enough we were getting results with one millisecond precision
We also repeated the test with an incandescent bulb just like the game and got the same super accurate results
Now to appreciate that one millisecond of precision one flap of a hummingbird wing takes 12
Milliseconds so one millisecond is literally this long if you pull out your phone and trying it the stopwatch to land on four point
Zero zero seconds that's really hard
And this is just a two decimal places
I had some friends of mine use a timer app that went out to three decimal places which is milliseconds
and then I
Challenged them to land exactly on four seconds and in one hundred tries these mere humans with their pitiful non machine reaction times
Were only able to do it once whereas my robot can do it pretty much every time
So there's definitely no error coming from the hardware components
But maybe the sensor is being told to trip at different times because there's so many additional
Flashing lights in an arcade and to investigate that we looked at the signal data from the sensor
Which looked really noisy
And low like this
until you see a spike in
Intensity every time the light would come around which is when the delay countdown would start because we have such a narrow field of view
On the sensor when we compared the time between each of the peaks it was also precise down to the millisecond so light pollution
Wasn't the issue either
With this in mind I headed to a different arcade with some family friends and their kids to see if things would be any different
And we did win a few jackpots
But for the most part once again
We would alternate missing by one light on either side of the jackpot without making any
Adjustments to my machine which as a reminder can repeatedly hit the same mark within
1/12 of a hummingbird wing flap and so at this point it was pretty clear that these games just randomly hand out rare jackpots
but just to be sure I did some digging and was able to locate a 25 year old manual for the cyclone arcade game and
Sure enough if you flipped all the way to the back to page 31 it states the machine owner can specify
How often they want a jackpot to be won
Which actually makes sense because in our testing a lot of times
"We'd hit a jackpot right away, and then go through a dry spell until we would finally get a jackpot again on average"
Maybe 30 games later and so in conclusion
My issue here isn't that this arcade game makes money for the arcade owner
My issue is this arcade game presents itself as a winnable game of skill when in reality
It's a random dice roll
That is heavily stacked against you
And if you recall from the carnival scam video the most lucrative games for the carnival owner are those where people overestimate
their chances of winning that is
Exactly what happens in this game
especially when you might play a few games
And get it to stop one light short or one light long thinking
You are so close to getting a jackpot when in reality you weren't close at all in gambling psychology
this is known as the near miss effect and people will spend much more money to try and win because they think they can just
Do it on the next one and for that reason it should come as no surprise
That this scam machine is considered the highest earning redemption arcade game ever made so if I were you
I'd save your tokens for skee-ball
There's a plunger in the backpack and then it pushes down on the thing is that cool
So you're basically cheating?
Well I mean cheating is a strong word I'm using an advantage I might have created myself
It's a new year
Which means it's time to make new goals and one of my new goals for this year
is learning how to make really cool motion graphics animations like the guys from the YouTube channel Kurzgesagt
And to do that I'm using skillshare.com
Who were also kind of to support this video. in this class they cover all the basics as well as how to animate their cool little bird
And there's a bunch of free downloadable files
So you can follow along with the instructions. And skillshare has a bunch of different courses from
photography to marketing to
tutorials on that you think you just bought or maybe you want to learn to make videos like this it's less than ten bucks a
Month for their premium membership and that gives you full access to all their classes and the first 300 people to use the link in
the video description
Get two months for you to try it out. So if you appreciate the work
I put into these videos and you want to start the new year off right by expanding your mind and setting a goal you can
"Actually achieve, click the link in the video description to get started"
Thanks for watching
hi everybody Jack Vale here so the other
day I got a random phone call from a
company representing themselves as the
United States federal government grant
Department offering me a grant for
ninety two hundred dollars the catch
they wanted me to pay them a $250
administration fee before I get the
money wired to me but what's really
gonna blow your mind is how they wanted
to be paid watch this how much money is
this yeah that's what the other
gentleman said good all right so how do
I give somebody this two hundred and
fifty dollars I'm gonna have with me and
and then I guess I'll get my nine
thousand two hundred dollars
you are going to purchase a gift card
with a section of cut-up photo with the
bag of yolk is a gift card all right

sensation
you've been talking with my husband
James about this gift card he is I've
got it scratched off for you can you
hear it are you ready for it yeah okay
it was mam now X as in xylophone B as in
boob t as in Teresa cuz she has big
boobs C as in Charlie K as in Kraft
macaroni and cheese l as in lettuce and
H as in holy crap I'm being scammed now
how many people do you folks like to
screw with I mean as a scam artist I
don't mean anything bad I just mean
since you're scamming people how many
people do you scam every day but who's
going to get this iTunes gift card then
so you get paid with the iTunes gift
card that's how the administration gets
paid can you hold on a minute I'm sorry
I'm sorry I'll be slower in a minute
hold on a second hello
government grants how're you doing today
pretty good how are you my dad is
actually on the other line
talking to a representative I believe
okay and how do they want that how what
kind of a card are they gonna pay with I
use an iTunes card you don't say I bet
it is yeah that sounds totally legit
that Apple would get involved in
something like that hold on one second
okay hold on let me get off the other
line here yeah are you there yeah all
right here we go
X as in X Y Z R as in rootbeer q as in
cutie pie K as in cloud yeah I can hear
you stop scamming people
I said stop scamming people go get a job
yeah pay me with an iTunes card and
"we'll send you $9,000 come on buddy you"
should feel guilty you should feel bad
for scamming people and you're not in
Washington DC by the way you're not in
Washington DC I can tell you that no sir
you're not shame on you shame on you for
scamming an old man shame on you jerk be
very very careful and be on guard all

you said your name was Dick Johnson dick
okay what's up it's like old but it's
new it was designed by the Internet the
internet designed it it just showed up
one day it was crazy
well here's the thing yeah I probably
need to go catch it because it's been
running for a while but I don't have
very good cardio so I I joined a gym and
it's only ten dollars a month what you
think about that dick well I would
suggest that we're no strangers to love
but you know the rules and so do I
[Music]
it's going very well my business I like
to use the wet wipes I find that the dry
toilet paper is a little bit rough on
the skin
[Laughter]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
you
[Music]
well imagine your phone rings and it
looks like your husband is calling but
on the line is a woman who says she has
his phone she claims to be a Canadian
Border Services agent and says he's
being detained and that you have to pay
money so he can be released well that's
what happened to one Ontario woman who
says a caller pressured her into
depositing ten thousand dollars into a
Bitcoin machine turning that cash into
virtual money they calling me from his
phone and that was the where I fell for
it obviously I'm totally shattered at
that point because they said they're
interrogating him at at this point and I
said I need to talk to him I said that a
couple of times and they said well he
cannot talk to anybody right now it's a
very very serious matter it's like a
possible criminal activity when it comes
to your family you want to be able to do
anything and everything I am giving
money willingly to save my family member
or wherever the situation it would just
like any other person would do for their
family it's a new twist on the Canada
Revenue scam police in Hamilton Ontario
say the woman whose identity we've
agreed to protect is one of several
fraud cases involving Bitcoin machines
they're currently investigating while
some may not understand how anyone could
be so gullible one psychologist tells us
scammers prey on victims emotions and
can on our fight-or-flight response to
keep us from making rational decisions
it's kind of like the body is saying
this is no time for thinking this is
time to either fight straight on or run
away fight or flee one way to think of
it is this short-term survival system
makes us stupid it takes away that high
level intellectual you know that's what
we use to figure out what courses to
take at university to get a job to
whatever that's what the frontal lobes
and all that intellectual stuff is for
and it's just been taken out of the
equation and so you know it's almost
like we need to use the word stupid
without the derogatory sense of it it
does make you intellectually impaired
now coming up we'll get some more tips
from dr. Jordans about how to make
better decision
when you're in that fight-or-flight mode
and protect yourself from potentially
being scammed the phone call came from
my husband's phone it was showing that
my husband was calling his picture and
everything was showing on the phone I'm
Janelle amass earlier in the show we
told you about a new type of scam where
the fraudster makes it look like they're
calling from your loved ones phone
they're in trouble and you need to send
money so they can get out we also heard
from a psychologist about why it's not
so easy to think rationally in these
situations where our mind goes into a
fight-or-flight mode ok that's why he
says one of the best things you can do
is remove yourself from the situation if
your frontal lobes are sort of depleted
she assumed she felt very confused very
hard to follow what's going on and it
wouldn't surprise me if the scammers
know these things too and they probably
changed the subject now and then or
bring in new information or do whatever
they can to keep her a confused state
when that emotional system kicks in
sometimes your only choice is to get
away from that situation so I assume
they tried to prevent her from doing
that too but you know if she was able
the nice thing would be to say listen
give me a call back in 10 minutes or
something or I need to check some stuff
out or whatever and I think that might
be a cue for other people that if if
someone's just not willing to give you a
second to kind of clear your head and
think about it then they probably don't
want you to clear your head and and that
alone should maybe be a trigger that
says you have to insist on it because I
don't think any real governmental agency
what is going to put you under that much
pressure and you know not be willing to
call back now one other thing that dr.
Jordans notes is that in this particular
situation this victim may have had an
unfair disadvantage she shared with us
that she had had a similar situation
before where her husband was in danger
so when she got that call it triggered
those same emotions that she had once
felt and that's why she was willing to
do anything she could to get him safe
Janell a massive City news
hey everybody Chris here with Cano films
hey yesterday I posted a video of me
trolling an IRS scammer yes they tried
to scam me so I played around and got
them back well today they tried calling
me again let's have some fun
oh yeah I had a missed call from this
number man
all right how do a notification Oh from
IRS in last two weeks
well I guess I have am I in trouble man
sorry am I in trouble
yeah [ __ ] all right
oh I wish you to have a balance paper
and write down some policy field that's
all 50 good macro oh damn it and this
just been my day I'll tell you what my
son is apparently on something called
acid and he's shooting a bow and arrow a
new crowd of people you know then I get
this phone call it's just been a day man
I swear hang on let me get my pen real
quick
all right you there man yeah
all right gravy bed all right so tell me
what's going on your name's Ryan yeah
Ryan when your last night
Williams yeah oh hell man I went to
school with the Ryan Williams man did
you play basketball 12th grade no no
well [ __ ] that's food blondie r-25 thing
okay hold on c6 all right employ ID the
DJ 9 8 7 1
seven one all right all right all right
yeah the case number is 81
147 for AC AC was a a C Slater AC like
from Saved by the Bell is that the first
two letters yeah Aysen and then uh huh
four okay got it okay no do not
interrupt me listen to me very carefully
once I complete my thought I will you
have fair enough to speak and really
efficient okay now iris has the 3d
allegation on your name postive
violation of federal tax evasion okay
yeah oh I found packs I do it myself man
you know yeah you do you happen you have
do you need my name Georgie do you have
my name or do you need it very fiery one
from the end cuz I gotta I gotta eat
something and take my back peel a
fighter named Frost
my name's my name is deke Dixon I detest
them the colossal feathers and you're
going to do a lot of favors here
wonderful you even okay a monster two
thousand nine hundred fifty one dollars
and that's under Dickie Dix is that
under my name Dickie Dix
yeah [ __ ] me
why's his always got a bapin to me you
know have you ever had a bad day in your
life man honey have you ever had a bad
day no you've never had a bad day
well good lord man this has been the
worst day
you've never had a bad day that's cool
man that's cool I wish I was you by the
state police or initiative Department
say what have you ever been arrested by
state police oh and you shouldn't
department oh [ __ ] man I have been
arrested so many times I got so many
felonies against me man
matter of fact last week I was running
around naked in my neighborhood and well
long story short I ended up in a jail
cell that night oh that was awesome guys
ah that was the best so guys lesson
learned if you get a phone call from
this number right here claiming it's the
IRS and and and they say that you owned
the money it's baloney the IRS will
never call you they will send something
to you in the mail I know my taxes are
fine this is so Bologna that was great
guys I'm Chris with Cano films please
subscribe thanks for watching and be
careful out there don't get scammed a
lot of people fall for this crap and
that pisses me off so I'm doing my duty
as a citizen to troll these guys back
they'll never mess with me again I
promise
see you later guys
hey guys in today's video I wanted to
share a very complication that's gonna
be very useful to many of you guys and
how people are checked yourself from any
scam phone calls or spam phone calls now
it's gonna be an application links will
be in the description this is not a
sponsorship at all it's just an
application I've been getting a lot of
use from and I thought I'd share with
you guys because lately I've been
getting a lot of telemarketer calls and
suspect spams now i'ma show you how this
application works here but I want to
show you first some of the calls I've
been getting and how they're being
identified here on my mists cause you
see right there the application has a
suspected spam telemarketer and it even
shows down here scam or fraud so if I
want to block a phone call with an iOS I
tap here within the I there and then
it's already blocked but I can unblock
it and then block it and that way I can
block of the caller now right here you
see that it's been identified so I know
from here on out that that person will
no longer be able to call me so the
application itself does have a few
settings right here you have the
identifier which you can paste the
number and identify that phone number to
see who it was
you also have a number pad here you have
also some general information that will
keep you up to date with how the system
is being constantly updated with the
latest BAM phone call numbers and things
like that and then you have a blacklist
so you can go ahead and block specific
numbers directly within the application
and then you have your options now let's
go into settings here and show you under
phone calls or phone options right here
so if I tap on phone you see here it
says call blog and identification right
here's where you'll find the application
you have to toggle this on in order to
get the application to block on the
phone numbers so I just wanted to go
ahead and share this application with
you guys because it's been very useful
for me and I think a lot of you guys
will appreciate this app it is free
again not a sponsorship just something
that's gonna allow you to prevent from
getting the scam and get a scam and spam
