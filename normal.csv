"And right now I'm sitting outside a scam call center, which is making over"
"$300,000 American a year. Yes. Probably not the smartest thing for me to be doing filming here."
"But anyway, we're doing it. That's how I roll. But what's worse than robbing"
all this money from foreigners is with every single scam called.
They're destroying India's reputation around the world. So let's get some revenge.
Let's call these scammers and blast them and then let's expose the owner of this call center.
Call them and have some fun with him.
"Before we call them, how the scam works is they place"
advertising on websites that tells you that you have a virus. You need to call them to get it fixed.
Then they try and charge you four hundred dollars or more and they don't fix anything. There's no virus on your computer.
"It is a total, total scam."
"So they're mainly targeting older, more computer illiterate"
people and they're making a ton of money from it. How sad is that? Targeting old people like that. That's what they do.
"So anyway, let's give them a call and yeah, listen to the lies and let's blast them."
Let's give these guys a call.

"Hi, who's this?"
"This is Victor. How may I help you out.

I can't share my personal information over here? So let me work on the computer. Okay?
Karl: This is safe?
"Scammer: Yes, of course."
"Karl: Okay, but you want to look at my files, right?"
Scammer: I'm not looking at files. I'm just working and checking all the things which are a little too overworked.
"All right. Give me a moment. Actually, there are a few services that have been stopped on your computer"
That's why it might be you to see the pop up. Can you show me the pop?

"Karl: Yeah, don't you worry about what I'm doing man. I just need to fix this before my wife comes home."
"Scammer: Alright, let me close this website for you right now or let me ignore that.

I'm getting worried man. I'm getting really worried.
Scammer: Worried about what?
"Scammer: Okay,"

So there are several foreign connections which have been established on your computer system.
"We have to remove this as soon as possible. All right?

"Scammer: Okay, so"
"Okay, there is a complete package."

"Okay, put your account number away."
Karl: Okay

"Scammer: Thank you for nah
Karl: no, no listen to me"
Listen
Scammer: No
Scammer: What
What are you trying to say?
"Scammer: I'm not an Indian. 
Karl: You're, you're an Indian from Delhi?"
We all know what's happening of these scams. Here you are man.
"Scammer: No Sir, where you from?
Karl: Delhi"
But I was born in Rohtak in Haryana.
"Scammer: Why did you call?
Karl: To screw with you to waste your time."
To tell you that you guys are bringing shame to all Indians. You're not even a 2 rupee person
"Scammer: How do you, what do you mean?"
Karl: So you don't speak Hindi?
"Scammer: I'm not an Indian. 
Karl: Don't lie. You're a liar."
Everything you told me is a lie.
Scammer: Why would I
"lie to you, you're telling me the lie. 
Karl: No, you're telling me the life is no virus there, man."
You're just a scammer from India. We all know it man.
Karl: No. Why do you do this? Are your parents proud of you? You're a scammer.
"Scammer: I'm not a scammer, I'm just providing you the supporting software. You see that while you're still pulling on the card."
"Karl: No, you guys are putting out. Who do you think brought the pop-up? Who do you think brought the pop-up?"
Scammer: You're wasting my time.
"Karl: Yeah, I am and you're scamming people."
Scammer: We are not scamming people bro.
"Karl: You are, you are scamming up here.
Scammer: Okay, that's time wasted on. Have a good thing. What's your name"
"by the way, it is not what
Karl: You'll find out my name soon. Don't worry."
"Scammer: All right 
Karl: Okay, 
Scammer: thank you, thank you"
"Scammer: I told you I didn't understand much. I can't speak much. Bye, have a good day."
"Karl: That guy was such a liar. And so this is what happens, right?"
it's absolutely nothing wrong with our computer. It is fine and they're not gonna fix anything.
It is all fake and a lie.
And if you thought I was being too harsh on this guy the way I talked to him.
"There was a time when these call center employees,"
actually thought they were working for Microsoft but these days there are so much awareness about scam call centers.
There has been so many raids by the police here that all these calls centers workers
now know when they're working for a scam call center. They can't plead ignorance anymore.
You saw how much that guy just straight-out lie to me. Telling me he's not even in Delhi.
I know for a fact they are.
Now let's confront the owner of this call center Himanshu Nigam from Uttar Pradesh.
But before that I have some good news for you about the call center and some bad news for me.
"So the bad news, obviously"
I'm not in the same place that I recorded the rest of this video right? I went away for four days. I came back and
My wife had cleaned the house.
Which meant she had thrown out the dining table that I was working on and I had been relegated to the sad little
corner of the desk. I will get my revenge on her.
That's the bad news for me.
The good news for you guys about this call center is my friend at YouTube Jim
"Browning, he has been flooding their call center with calls over the last few days. He has been getting people"
refunds from visa. He's been getting the call centers phone numbers shut down and he's about to
report them to the US authorities and the Indian authorities.
So go and check out Jim's channel. He is
"basically, a one-man army against these scam call centers here in India and he has taken them down one at a time."
Let's give Himanshu Nigam a call now and let's see what he
to say.
"You are Himanshu Nigam, the boss of a new technology limited who's running a scam call center in Rohini sector three and"
"actually, I've been doing an investigation into"
your operation just scam call center and there's gonna be a video coming out on YouTube when multiple videos are coming
"about your scam call center and you might have noticed this week Jim Browning, he was flooding your course into with calls."
And we also know about Mahir Shah. He is your contact in the US.
"And you guys have been reported to the Indian police and the US police. Okay, it might be time for you guys to move offices."
"No, bro, you're lying you're completely lying. So Himanshu says he has nothing to do with this."
"He is innocent, but if you just dig a little deeper."
You'll find all the information you need to prove that he is just a complete liar. So these scam call centers they operate behind
legitimate businesses. They are fake businesses. They are shell
"companies and if you look up renewed technology Private Limited and look at this Facebook page, you're gonna find in"
2018 they're hiring
candidates for the US and UK shift.
"Exactly the people they are scamming he told us he does search engine optimization seo, right?"
Complete liar. Look at the username there.
"HR and Nigam. He has set up this page and he's been posting to this page. You've got the address there, Rohini."
"Exactly where this call center is. Now if we go to the website, this is the fake"
"website, the shell company they use to hide the call center for new technology limited."
"Look at just how fake this is, the websites not even finished. It is just super generic."
It's not a real website and if you just go to the about Us page it says here.
Dedicated call centre.
"the first rule of doing anything wrong is never ever admit your crime when you're caught, right?"
So that's all Himanshu doing all the evidence that Jim has showed me shows that he is absolutely
the owner of this operation.
We as Indians need to fight these scam call centers they're destroying our reputation
"around the world. When foreigners get these calls from these scam call centers,"
"They begin to think that all Indians are like this, but it's not true. It couldn't be further from the truth."
"Indians are the most hospitable people in the world, right? If you want to see a full"
investigation and all the evidence against the scam call center go to Jim Browning's channel watch this video.
I have a link to it in the description and if you want to support the work that I do and you want some member-only
"benefits, head that join button and become part of the rock army. 
Long live India."
common on the internet but sometimes
it's possible to find out the full
details of exactly who's behind the
phone number on screen and to give those
scammers a real scare this is a computer
support company sir and let me tell you
sir in order to run the diagnostic I
remotely so I followed this person's
instructions and I was told to download
supremo control once he had control of
my desktop he downloaded some further
my screen when necessary he also
prevent me from seeing screen connect in
my list of installed programs a new
tactic I hadn't seen before and I'm sure
will be duplicated by other scammers
and once he'd hidden his remote access
software from the installation list he
sent me a contract by email scammers
agencies so they can hold on to their
money in the event of a dispute I've
company finally he revealed all of this
company's details so if you open this up
you will have this tecnique IT solutions
LLC that's the name of a company and
here's the toll-free number this is my
name we will be available for Monday to
Saturday 11:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. with
distance Standard Time okay
like most scams they will register a
completely fake company name and give it
a website to make it look legitimate
their website was more professional than
most and they even had some reviews on
the Better Business Bureau but upon
closer inspection very many of these
reviews seemed to have lots of spelling
and grammar mistakes indicating that
they were probably their own reviews
I've been untouched with a Better
Business Bureau and hopefully these fake
reviews will be removed soon but as
always I used the scammers connection in
Reverse so that I can see what's
happening at the scammers side so as J
I was watching what was going on on Jays
computer I'm getting this off option you
have two cards one is the card ending
with one or two eight and one is ending
I can do it so let's have a closer look
at what the scammer is doing here the
screen in the center is my own PC but
surrounding it is connect wise control
the various buttons around this or what
the scammer uses to freeze or blank my
computer or date take control over the
keyboard and mice behind all of this is
a webpage showing the most recent
names of the people who have recently
been scammed I've reported their account
who you always take very rapid action
shut them dine hi ever I'd really like
other they seem to be quite a small
organization only about three or four of
them and the boss's name was arch it
arch it butts the only one he was using
his real name the other scammers were
called Paul Tintin and Jay and it was
obvious that these scammers were working
from home as was evident whenever Jay
called his boss arch it and I could hear
baby crying in the background very okay
question either customer will receive
cord on a cell phone or on email hey I'm
a nice camel gotta call literally Kwanza
yawns akalabeth away at this point I
tell them that the bank have called me
to tell me that the whole thing is a
scam and that usually puts them off but
Jay tries to convince me otherwise
if you check okay do one thing sir if
you really don't believe me you can
check the reviews you can check the
reviews for my customers we have got a 1
reviews 8 plus it reviews in you know
from Better Business Bureau it seems
they're using the Better Business
reviews as a way to appear legitimate
the quicker these can be removed the
better
well fine sir I'm gonna do one thing uh
you can go ahead and do the research but
I did what I have to do on your computer
I help you out
so well you just got a call from your
back I'm saying that this is not legit
and all of a sudden you know yes you
know everything is just changed so I was
just speaking with a manager regarding
about the service that you took the
service that you took from us security
he said you will have to speak with a
billing department and if the billing
department doesn't agree with that then
we'll have to I'm sorry to say I have
you
so as Jay was trying to convince me that
they were legitimate I was having a look
closely at one of their two websites on
the second website called technics us
there was a designed by article media
sky in the bottom right this would turn
out to be the real company name so as I
watched him run the identical scam on
this person who's called Lloyd I thought
I would call up the various members of
this team and challenge them announced
they were scamming Lloyd they noticed
that a file had been left from a
different scamming organization this guy
had been scammed before they looked at
the my tech text file sitting in the
support with a different phone number so
they pretty quickly deleted that file
and this is what I find quite a lot
if you fall victim to one of these scams
your phone number will undoubtedly work
its way around at hundreds of call
centers the victims will then be
bombarded by other scams including the
refund scam this happens so much that
scammers now have a password system they
instruct their victims that if the
person on the end of the phone can't
quote the agreed password to hang up the
call they will also warn the victims
that they're likely to receive other
calls this is because they sell their
victims own data I'll show more on this
password system in a future video
but I want to D call the number on the
pop up to speak to other members of the
team this time I ended up speaking to
Nitin or Tintin dangit Carlene I hope in
a whole be yeah hello I've gotta support
alert here I can't get rid of us who is
this by the way what we do we get
actually doing on a computer when you've
got a problem this question is always
part of the script it implies that the
user did something wrong not that they
set this up so like his colleague Jay
computer I went along with it
okay it's connecting
okay cool now I have your screen I can
look at what you're looking at here
is what you got yeah not going to
disappear mm-hmm no does anyone else use
this computer apart from you sir
not really no and what you do mostly on
the computer you know I tracked down
scammer and on the Internet

first made checking account you know
turning around right they didn't have
they didn't have a way for you to check
how much money you have you had to call
a bank and then that's why they made the
checking account so you can you can
check us right now the phone in which
I'm talking to you this is your cell
phone or this is your home phone well I
don't know what that is any finger doing
anything but it happens to be my

[Music]
over the past six months I've had
unprecedented access to a scam call
center YouTube's policies have meant
that I've had to blur certain sections
of this video but I fear patron of mine
you can access the full uncensored
version through patreon this video gives
operate and who these scammers really
are critical alert for a boycott you're
ever boo
he is currently uploading phone numbers
victims all of the phone numbers are
from people who have previously fallen
victim to a pop-up scam as you can see
here knowing that these people are
already victims is particularly useful
to this group of scammers because they
be a real computer company and make
calls like this while we are calling you
computer support and services
unfortunately we are closing the
business so you can give us a call for
and the rest of the people in this call
him using what's up to download a
spreadsheet of the most recent victims
when he has the list of numbers he will
then look at it in a spreadsheet to make
sure that it will go in to the IKE mind
calling software he will remove any
duplicates before starting a campion
here they've been emailed a fresh list
of numbers once they've done loaded this
list they will start up their VoIP
software here they're using Vox
account.com and that's a legitimate
piece of software which will allow them
to make lots of I'd mine calls they will
charge up their Vox account with about
$100 every few days and the it ursery
agents will sit and wait for inbound
calls here you can see the rate of these
calls the icons at the bottom
present agents who are ready to receive
calls and there in green and anyone
actively engaged in the call is colored
amber so let's go for a little office
tear whenever one of these outlined
campaigns are in action as you can see
the offices are very small and cramped
and each agent has only a very basic PC
on this desk
they don't use phones and instead use
their in bond coals and 3cx
for the I'd find ones a lot of these
scammers smoke so you can imagine the
smell in this place but this particular
PC is a laptop so it can be carried
round the office so courtesy of this
particular scammer we're going to get a
little tier of exactly what the office
looks like listen carefully to these
scams going on in the background
option I love you dmg
so as you can see they're quite small
offices one of the smaller scripts of
scammers I've encountered but equally
you can also pre see it that this laptop
is on a wireless network and it's that
wireless network that gives me a good
clue as to exactly where these offices
are located I already knew from the IP
address what the approximate location
was there in Calcutta or Kolkata in
India but to pinpoint their location
it's possible to use additional
information and I get this from their
wireless access information on screen
you can see a list of wireless networks
this PC has connected to those wireless
networks and someone are even active now
together with the signal strength and
using some Google map data it's possible
to pinpoint their location within 150
meters so these scammers are close to
the center of Kolkata
to the east of the river and very near
the rip on residency I needed to be as
accurate as I could with their location
because I wanted to report them to the
cyber police in Kolkata I couldn't give
them a business address because they're
not a business they just all know each
other so I also wanted to figure out
their various names but I could only do
this by listening to some audio so I
listened and watched their scams over
the next few weeks and months I was
particularly keen to identify this group
because they did some of the most awful
things that I've seen any group do
before the person on screen is called
Kristie they offered her a refund but
instead they turned on her webcam
children and ultimately tried to delete
all of her files that you do have but
you told me that I don't want that money
our software and when we took our
software's that happened you know your
all the documents that you do have on
your computer whatever all has been
deleted from your computer okay if you
haven't seen this video there's a link
to it in the description below so over
the next few weeks I observe
if they've transferred money to the
course they describe themselves as n TS
IE t care these are another scamming
organization in Kolkata where they get
most of their data from but there's a
rules that I'm going to let you know but
before going to let you know I do
believe you can see a computer screen
and if you can see your computer screen
ma'am so first of all do me a favor
Maddie the refund scam works by the
to their bank account he will have
promised a certain amount but they'll
edit the screen so it looks as if too
much has been put in
he will then ask the victim to return
more likely these days some sort of gift
card when you're going to your bank
right again to sending that money
exactly so you don't need to tell your
bank people that hey I had transferred
that money on the first time the money
gets Gansey and that's why I ask like
you can watch him on this webcam
coaching the victim what to say when she
goes into the bank I might be I don't
know because I live in California you
know so bad okay suppose if the same
people okay until they may I want to
transfer that money when you tell them
that might be they can open your bank
account and check that all right but
they will not ask you this thing that
hey this money's get cancelled because
the reason we
of course but you can tell them hey I
want to transfer again to him because
it's required right so you can tie my
double just see on the circuit no they
will not ask you this money get back to
you or whatever because the reason we
are hiding these things from your bank
you Bank people they will not able to
see that the money get canceled I'm
telling you that right the refund scam
usually requires the victim not to speak
to anyone in the bank on this particular
scammer has persuaded her that the bank
are in on a scam are not to mention any
details to anyone in the bank
you know just
no they can't see that because you see
connected to each other so I had shown
you this thing that hey ma'am this has
happened but in the computer your bank
computer screen will be not sure that
the money get counted it just shows that
29000 $250 has been created but this
thing it will be not shows that money
get cancelled understand I'm telling you
that because I am the man of my water
and at the same time your bank and the
my bank they are connected to each other
and I will not give the permissions to
your bank as well that they can look
that the money get canceled and that's
why you've come here okay I'm telling
you that all this time I was quietly
observing their scams in action and I
didn't let any of the victims that I
observed fall victim to any of the scams
but I did want to disrupt them as much
as I possibly could so when we observed
them making contact with a company
called dialer 360 calm in order to set
up a new outline camp in I saw an
opportunity what they do is send an ID
bind message to potential victims about
a refund and this was my opportunity to
substitute the audio interestingly I
also observed that dialer 360 were
completely complicit in the scam that
was going on in fact they even wanted
the audio which would be played to the
victims they didn't have the expertise
themselves so they drafted in an expert
cold house rock who set up dalla 360 so
that this group of scammers were set up
correctly to scam the maximum number of
victims dialer 360 didn't exactly care
who was buying their software and
card the reply was why no one's ever
asked for that before
I'm not seem perfectly acceptable $2.00
360 they allocated the direct
International dial or D ID number
regardless so I thought carefully about
the best way to disrupt this new
campaign obviously I couldn't stop them
getting new numbers but what I could do
is hopefully get a warning to their
tential victims so I thought I would
substitute the audio this is what their
original audio signed it like how we are
Department if you remember you have a
and services unfortunately we are
closing the business so you can give us
a call for the refund of the amount you
on seven four seven two one two nine
eight eight seven
I repeat seven four seven two one two
nine eight eight seven or press one to
talk with our executive thank you I'm I
decided to replace it with this hello
this is an automated message being sent
from scammers from India they were going
to try to scam you by claiming that you
would get a refund from your computer
maintenance company however this is just
a scam so that they can access your
your bank account if you ever get a
message like this it is always a scam
please do not mention that I have
changed their message but if you would
like to waste their time you can speak
to these scammers by pressing one on
your telephone keypad and as it turned
out this was the most effective way of
getting a message to some of their
potential victims all the expense of the
people making the calls the scammers
themselves not only did I keep
substituting the audio and only
replacing it whenever they were asking
it for a bit of help from dialer 360 but
I also increased the rate of these calls
to drain their money as quickly as I
possibly could allow this footage is
sped up
I watched overnight as I drained all of
their money the total consumption is the
cost in dollars and every cent which is
being consumed means a message is
getting to one of their prospective
victims all very satisfying and all this
time they couldn't work out why they
weren't getting the expected volume of
calls from the chat logs it was quite
obvious to them that they were having
some sort of
problem but couldn't pinpoint it
eventually when I drained all of their
money over several weeks they figured
out there must been some sort of
compromise and finally they twigged that
there was something going on with their
audio but I still had very blurry
photographs through a webcam of the
people involved so ice thrilled whenever
Dever uploaded his wedding photographs
to the internet and I was able to get a
lot clearer pictures of his workmates so
although I don't know who's who here I
do know there's an amat there's a Rizwan
there's a two civ and there's a Waseem I
did email the Kolkata cyber police and
hope that they would do something I sent
them a link to the unblurred version of
this video but I've had absolutely
nothing back from them I can only assume
they're not going to do anything
therefore I'm left for posting this to
YouTube and you'll also find a link in
the description to the unblurred version
which is on d tube if I hear back from
the police I'll be sure to post not this
but the first people who get to know are
my patrons and I thank them for
sponsoring me if you wish to become a
patron there's a link here and I'm also
on Twitter up Jim browning 11:00 again
thank you for watching

today we are exposing scammers not
one not two but six scammers from the
same location
so it all starts as a typical scam the

to their manager
which i explained best in this clip you
need to go ahead and get
to my manager right now manager is going
through

y'all so if we have tricked them
some days it's good some days it's bad
i'm not going to count the chickens
before they hatch we're at the truth and
as you all see i put in some extra
things like hell's kitchen target.com
sirius
all these different things to make it
look a little bit more lifelike we did a
lower
dollar amount as well by staying safe
and secure as if it's not fraudulent the
scammers try to make it seem like
they're protecting you
and keeping you out of harm's way we
want
secure and safe transaction okay
no any fraudulent transaction to be
happen we want
your information the screen's about to
be hidden because the scammer doesn't
want you to see what's about to happen
i will go ahead and log in into my
company's account
and you know the rules of the company
whenever we open up
my company's bank account the screen
turned black from your rent
surgery i tell this scammer multiple
times
that i need surgery let's see how this
guy responds

pay your surgery
chris you've got my company's money in
your account because if i can't pay then
they're gonna take my house
you got my company's money in that oh
why don't you understand that
the scammers have me put 300 into a
refund
form and from there they're gonna go and
change it to make it look like
they gave me thirty thousand dollars and
three hundred dollar when you will be
putting it
the money will be instantly hit in your
account ma'am
because you are the only authorized
person who can go ahead and put the
amount
you didn't mean to put 30 000 but by
mistake
you have put that money but you got the
money in your account from my company's
mom and you have to
return that money because this is not
the amount which you supposed to get
now that i've got thirty thousand
dollars whoo
celebration let's go no no no no
they just make it look like they gave me
thirty thousand dollars by editing the
html in the background
phone hang ups not only are these
scammers despicable but it's really
really fun to hang up on them in the
middle of the conversation
okay all right now listen to me ma'am
listen to me hello hello listen to me
ma'am
and if your bank will go ahead and ask
you why are you withdrawn
now i i think i have a service point
right in my
can you hear me now is it better
though scammers need that 30 000 as soon
as possible
so we're about to go take a trip to the
good old bank to go get that money out
the scammers will then
coach me on what to say how to say it
and when to say it
and you need to send us the rest of the
money
which is 29 and 500
dollars that for what purpose you are
withdrawing the cash for
then what are you going to tell them can
you tell me um
amazon no you don't need to tell them
anything about the amazon or anything
like that
otherwise the mistake will get
highlighted ma'am
you can tell them that you're buying it
for your home purpose all right here we
go
we're near the finish line we've got the
money but the scammers want
video and photo evidence and proof that
i got the money out

this camera you just watched getting
pissed off is in a call center in india
with about 10 other guys out of these 10
machines i have taken remote access of
nine of them with the help of social
engineering
and spreading my access across their
network first let's take a quick look at
the social engineering
should i click on canceller no no no
click on accept
click on accept yeah i clicked on accept
let's give it a second it says
okay do one thing simply uh click on all
the boxes
do you see below the permissions all the
boxes over there
below the permission oh yeah okay
hey you want me to use capitals or
hello hello yep he's gone i got him
first thing i did once i got this
initial connection was running a scan on
the network of the scammers
to find vulnerabilities this call center
was very outdated when it comes to
software which meant that i was able to
spread the 90
of the computers in the call center i
downloaded all the files from the
machines that i got access to
and found some interesting files on
there on the first pc there was an xlsx
file which is a spreadsheets file
it was called 10k ashish the name of the
file is exactly what the file is
there's a list with information of 10k
or 10 000 potential victims
including their phone number first name
last name address
city state postal code and their email
address and then almost all the scammers
had txt
files notepad files on their computer
with victim information when they are
talking to victims or the victims are
filling out the refund form the scammers
type along
noting down stuff like their date of
birth their phone number etc what you
see on the screen right now is all the
data that was in these notepad files i
counted everything
and this is all that it included this is
pretty scary when you look at it
of course i was also interested to see
where these cameras were based and as
you can see from this ips lookup web
page
it shows us that the geolocation of the
scammers is in kolkata a quick gps
coordinate scan
on the reverse proxy of the scammer's
network confirms this location
now what scam do these guys actually run
let's take a look at the start of a call
to see how they see themselves
yeah thank you being connected with the
premium support
this is ragnar from the councils and
department how are you doing today madam
all right you want to cancel the
services right so for that you have to
just be in front of a computer that
that i can provide you the cancellation
form right man imagine
uh like we are going to provide you the
online cancellation form right you can
get the cancellation form only in your
computer or laptop
okay and after the cancellation has been
right are you in front of your computer
now
so they're running a typical tech
support refund scam
where they will send out voicemails and
emails telling people that their
will get a refund for that
once on the call with the scammers they
take remote access of the victim's
computer
make the victims file the refund form
manipulate the bank account to make it
seem like they refunded too much money
and forced the victim to pay this money
back in the form of gift cards when the
victim doesn't want to get gift cards
they also have the option to pay through
wire
or send money in a box to a money meal
which you probably have seen with mark
rober and jim browning now let's see how
these cameras do
when they actually get a victim let's
see this came in practice and do you see
this
desk this desk and there's a nine digit
numbers
do you see it's a set password for
unattended access
and the blue box remote desk no no
i'm sorry love i'm sorry okay you have
to open that page where it says this
desk okay
yeah the nine digit numbers the scammer
makes this old lady set a password for
unattended access
so he can log into her computer whenever
he feels like it he also makes the
victim install the program so he can
blacken out a screen
with any desks built in privacy mode and
this way any desk will also run whenever
the computer starts up
this way this camera can spy on the
victim whenever he feels like it seems
like this camera is in this call center
got instructed to do this
because i saw all of them using this
method forcing the victim to install the
program and to set a password and i also
caught them spying on their victims over
a dozen times
in this instance we can see the scammer
sniffing around in a victim's banking
page and after he realizes that he
cannot send himself money through the
online banking page
he decides to casually watch the
victim's webcam if you think this is bad
then just wait in this next instance the
scammer goes even further he goes onto a
victim's computer
blackens out her screen and tries to
purchase himself some gift cards through
the old lady's credit card that is
attached to her amazon account
luckily this lady knew something wasn't
right and turned off the computer and
every time a victim did not realize this
that something was wrong or they weren't
there to kind of see what was going on i
always tried to look for their personal
information or i called their family
members to warn them let's listen
to one of these calls with the victims
oh what are you talking about the number
i called the ones i talked to
yeah the one that's on your computer how
did you get that number on your computer
did somebody
when i purcha when i purchased my
security last year
he that came up after i
we got everything situated and i was um
i paid 159 for one year protection
i don't want to stress you out or
anything but those guys were probably
scammers as well
i'm not sure but i'm i'm pretty sure
they were man yup
yup i believe it now because what
happened last year
i clicked on it all hell broke loose
bells went off
alarms went off and then
huh yeah fire's message that said
something like a spyware alert and then
a microsoft yeah
yeah so this guy had already been
scammed i'm not sure if it was from the
same scammers and they still had his any
desk id and password from
last year or this guy was just very
unlucky and he got targeted twice
and then there's one last instance this
is the most popular one that these
cameras like to use i'd never actually
heard this before
since i started scan baiting but
apparently there's something called
zella pay and this is where you can pay
people that you trust
through your banking page without any
confirmation through your phone
or any cvv numbers scammers really love
this of course because they don't need
to go through any security checks or
verification checks
and they can just make themselves a
trusted person when the victim leaves
their computer on
and leaves it unattended we can see that
from the victim's
zella account 500 has been sent to a guy
with the name
rafael caballero and this was on the
exact same date the scammers were
sniffing around on the victim's computer
so i'm sure that the scammers did this
they were also trying to send more money
but i'm not sure if this worked out
i tried to reach out to the victim i
called all his family members but nobody
picked up
i did leave some voicemails though at
some family members their phone number
so i hope that these guys reach out to
me
or they reach out to other people for
help after stealing that money from him
they still decided to watch his webcam
while his screen was blackened out he
did shut off his computer
but after this i have still seen this
camera spying on this exact victim
so he hasn't realized that something is
wrong now let's go back to the scan with
the old lady
after making her fill out the password
for the unintended axis and making her
install any desk
this camera takes her to a refund form
sold on for a moment
once once you receive any forms by your
end you have to let me know okay
yes eric i got the form okay
you will be getting the form by your end
okay now you have to fold this form by
yourself okay
this specific form was hosted by micro
server bot and i reported the form to
them before this they were using a
different web page to host their form
which was jet form and i also reported
that form
and they emailed me back in less than 24
hours saying that they took down the
form
and they even banned the scammers their
ip address so there's no way for them to
make any other forms when the victim has
finished filling out the form
the scammers will tell the victim to go
log into their banking page and they
have to accept the payment there will be
a pop-up apparently in their banking
page
that will say accept or decline the
payment okay ma'am now what
ma'am you there yep ma'am listen to me
okay
what do you got you have to read it out
to me yeah what do you need to do ma'am
right we have to give you the refund on
your account okay you have to go
and check the statement and accept the
payments from the money has been credit
in your account which is 399 dollars
right so what do you need to do you have
payment okay this victim
actually ended up logging into her bank
account but when the scammers blackened
her screen
she wasn't having it and she hung up the
phone and shut down her computer when
the victims don't do what the scammer
says they don't really like that what
happened
of course the scammer always can go one
step further than just cussing out the
victim
because when they are still connected to
the victim and the victim does not
comply
they will try to lock the victim's
computer by putting a system password on
there and then taking the machine for
ransom i couldn't step in with this
because that would be way too noisy and
the scammers would know that i had
remote access to their machines but i
did end up connecting to the victim's
computer because i had their handy desk
id and the password
and i left her a little note that you
can see on the screen right now i never
actually heard back from her but i'm
pretty sure that this should help her i
saved the file to her desktop as well
and put it in the middle of her screen
so i'm sure that she read all this now
what actually happens when the scammer
successfully convinced someone that they
refunded too much money
and that they need to get that money
back from the victim for the next
footage i'm going to show you
we are dealing with a 70 year old lady
from ohio that has a macbook i did not
follow this scam
but when i turned on my virtual machine
i joined in the middle of this scam the
woman had already been to target and had
bought two gift cards worth of 500
each for the scammers and she was on her
way to best buy to get even more gift
cards
okay what you need to do exactly in the
best buy
you need to tell to the store people i
worth of 500 you need to buy two gift
cards
and first of all you need to tell them
like i will pay this money for a check
okay i will write it down a check all
right
uh with your bank
edward bank and don't discuss anything
like i can
call up like i call up to the bank and i
turn everything uh to the best of my
play don't
don't like tell anything what i said to
you okay
okay come back and talk to me okay and
try to done it okay
unfortunately because i just came in the
middle of the scam
i didn't know anything about the victim
that was until the scammer started
snooping around her files he started
messing with her macbook
which is what you see on the screen
right now from one of these files i
could see like an
email or something and her full name was
in there so i tried to look for her
number i called her many times but she
didn't pick up the phone i called a
bunch of family members of her but they
didn't pick up either
so i was kind of clueless of what to do
on top of this
while she was in the best buy getting
those gift cards not only was this
camera messing around with her files
he also tried to purchase even more gift
cards from her amazon account with a
credit card that was attached to her
account the scammer literally knew
everything about her he knew her
password she knew her social security
number
he knew what her credit card information
was and he just knew
everything about this woman she had
given everything away when the scammer
was trying to purchase these gift cards
i couldn't resist but to shut off the
victim's computer usually i don't step
in like this because it's way too noisy
and the scammers will know that i have
hacked them but i couldn't stand
watching this and not doing anything
after i shut the computer down
this camera thinks somebody in the home
of the woman actually shot down the
computer
so i was in the clear
after this incident the scammer tried to
see how much money was on the target
gift cards the victim had bought for him
i could also see the gift card numbers
and codes that he was typing on his
computer
and i took screenshots of these numbers
i sent these screenshots to a friend of
mine on discord
and he has contacts within target and in
less than three minutes they blocked the
cards for me scammer thought that the
woman had been scammed by target
and told her to leave best buy and go
back to target to get new cars from
there when he sent her back to this
target i decided to call target and warn
them that somebody was being scammed and
the person that was in the store and
that took my call wasn't really
cooperative with me
service this is megan how can i help you
yes hello megan you're speaking with
james boiler
i'm a scam investigator and i just
wanted to warn you guys that somebody is
coming to your store in illyria ohio to
buy gift cards for scammers
i don't know if you are in the store but
i would like want to ask you if you
could maybe warn that
person that is coming to your store that
they are being scanned because i cannot
reach them on their phone
because the scammers are occupying the
line okay thank you
okay so do you need me to like describe
what she looks like what her name is or
no all my team knows what to look out
for oh she
already bought gift cards and they
didn't like warner anything so
i just wanted to let you know we have
messages all over the registers
yeah but you have to understand that
these cameras are very good at social
engineering
and they convince the victims she
already bought gift cards at your store
so
clearly your warnings aren't working i
just wanted to warn you that she's
coming back to get more gift cards
yeah i mean unfortunately we deny a
guest from purchasing something we can
only have
the signs displayed and try and talk
them out of purchasing
the gift cards so we're doing everything
on our part
yeah that's what i'm saying if she comes
in the store her name is brenda
she tries to buy gift cards kay please
tell her that she's being scammed to
hang up the phone with those guys
yes alright thank you so much you're
welcome
have a nice day after this it seemed
like the victim didn't go to target
she went back home and this camera told
her that he was gonna call her back
tomorrow
the scammer hung up the phone with the
victim with the plan to call her
tomorrow and scam even more money out of
her
and this was the perfect opportunity for
me to call the victim and warn her
but i didn't have a phone number so i
decided to do something that kind of
goes against my morals and i connected
to her computer with her any desk id and
password again
without her knowledge while she was
browsing on her safari i typed a message
for her with my phone number
and i needed to talk to her as you can
see she wasn't very
happy with this understandably she was
confused and she shut down her computer
and didn't call me 20 minutes later
i could see her computer was back up and
i decided to just do it again
i had to do anything to save this woman
and i told her later that i was sorry
for just connecting to her computer like
this but i really wanted to get to her i
even blocked her input
so she couldn't shut off the computer
again and she had to call me and luckily
she did hello
yeah you're speaking with james boiler
this what i'm a scam investigator is
this brenda
yes how do i know you're a scam
investigator yeah i can show you my
youtube channel
if you want me to um i've just been
following along the whole day but i
couldn't reach you for some reason i
couldn't find your number anywhere
the guys you were talking to are
scammers from india and i just felt
really bad they were trying to steal
money from you i just wanted to let you
know
like please please don't pick up any
calls don't buy them any gift cards
because they're trying to steal money
from you okay
isn't everybody i mean you've got
control of my computer now
yeah i'm really sorry about that it's
just the only way i could reach you
i i don't know i didn't know what else
to do you know so i then went on to
explain to her who i was
by showing her my youtube channel and i
also told her that i had been following
along with the scam the whole day
that i've been trying to reach her and
that i was the one that blocked the
turret cards and that's why the balance
was zero
let's take a look you see that that's
the same voice
it sounds like you but i'm sorry i don't
know what to believe anymore
yeah i know i understand like if you
want me to i can explain how their scam
works and
i then went on to remove the password
from her any desk so this cameras
couldn't connect to her computer anymore
and whilst doing this the scammer tried
calling her and tried to connect to her
computer again
hmm all right yeah i think sorry
yeah that's that's not an issue they're
i think they're trying to connect right
now you see
it's they're trying to connect two to
eight like
they're trying to access your machine
right now if they call you they're
they're gonna try to convince you that
you are wrong and then took it to a
webpage to explain how this can work and
she recognized everything the scammers
did so then she fully trusted me that i
was the good person
and those guys were actually scammers
and then it says the overpayment
the man so yeah we paid you too much man
we need to get that money back i'm gonna
lose my job you need to get me gift
cards that was the way it went
if you want to watch a video on it this
is uh another youtuber he does the same
thing as me his name is
jim browning after this she revealed to
me that she had also bought gift cards
the day before
from walmart she bought them 500 in best
buy gift cards as well i know yesterday
got a walmart card i think that was five
hundred dollars
did you buy that for them yeah it showed
a zero balance also
target said that that shows zero balance
i'm thinking to myself
is he going in there and cashing those
out kind of
and then having me go back so i'm
getting money to buy more
after this i instructed her what to do
if the scammers would ever call her back
what to say
and i told her that her computer was
safe now she could use it without his
cameras actually connecting to her
unwillingly and after doing all this we
said our goodbyes
all right thank you so much all right
i'm gonna disconnect now
uh yeah if you have any questions you
can call me so yeah
okay thank you have a good day yeah have
a nice day as well
thank you bye-bye
some of you guys might have already
noticed that on the scammers they're
calling device from
ringcentral an american company is
displayed as the team's name when i
first saw this i started doing some
research into this
company name and i came across an
article on scammer.info from
aussiescanbuster he posted this article
on september 18th
2020 and he wrote about how a gregory
owned several different scam web pages
and that his wife shirley also owned
several different scammer numbers and
web pages as well i then went on
gregory's company webpage
creverysquad.com where it says he is
into renovating homes there's also a
picture of gregory there and that is the
same guy that appears in a mug shot of a
news article
that says he ignited a bucket bomb at
his landlord's home and he went to
prison for that offense for several
years i'm sure gregory is involved with
this call center
and that the scammers are abusing his
llc to get a license from ring central
so they can call victims abusing this
phone system
i reported this operation touring
central so the scammers that didn't get
destroyed cannot continue their scam
and that the ones destroyed and that
will return cannot get back to scamming
once they reset the computers
ringcentral
replied on twitter within an hour saying
they were sharing this information with
their fraud team and after 18 hours i
asked them for an update and they told
me that they had shut down the scammers
their campaign the scammers that didn't
get destroyed
that i still had access to are after a
week now continuing their scams on ibm
i'll make another video on this call
center and we'll keep destroying them
until they reset all the computers in
the call center to a fresh windows
version with an anti-virus software on
there you don't want to miss this
then make sure you subscribe because i
have some very good ideas with these
guys i wanted to ask gregory a few
questions and tried to call him on
several different numbers on several
different occasions but he never picked
up on one occasion though
when i called his company number gregory
didn't pick up but somebody from india
did it was some random indian dude he
didn't say a word to me but this
confirms that gregory has contacts
within india
hello
very professional for a business number
unfortunately i could not confront
gregory
so then it was time for me to confront
the scammers in gregory's call center
for this i didn't do it myself but i got
